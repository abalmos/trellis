# Design: Auth Operations

## Prerequisites

- [trellis-auth.md](./trellis-auth.md) - auth architecture and trust model
- [auth-protocol.md](./auth-protocol.md) - internal state and auth-callout
  protocol

## Scope

This document defines the operational and deployment guidance for Trellis auth.

It covers:

- configuration defaults
- deployment checklist
- HA and availability concerns
- secrets handling
- rate limiting
- key rotation
- accepted operational risks

## Configuration

### TTL Defaults

| Config key       | Default | Description                         |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ttlMs.sessions` | 24h     | Session expires after inactivity    |
| `ttlMs.natsJwt`  | 1h      | NATS JWT expiry; triggers reconnect |

Relationship: `ttlMs.natsJwt < ttlMs.sessions`.

Reducing `ttlMs.natsJwt` increases reconnect frequency but does not change RPC
request-id replay-cache retention.

### Per-service Secrets

| Config key                        | Description                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| provisioned service identity seed | Immutable deployment identity credential |
| `client.nats_servers`             | Native NATS server URL(s)                |
| `client.ws_nats_servers`          | Browser/WebSocket NATS server URL(s)     |

Additional `trellis` service config:

| Config key                        | Description                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `nats.runtime.auth_creds_path`    | Auth account credentials     |
| `nats.runtime.trellis_creds_path` | Trellis account credentials  |
| `nats.runtime.system_creds_path`  | System account credentials   |
| `storage.sqlite_path`             | SQLite auth/control-plane DB |

### Store TTLs

| Store                  | TTL                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| sessions               | SQL rows, expired from `ttlMs.sessions` |
| users                  | None                                    |
| oauthStates            | 5 min                                   |
| pendingAuth            | 5 min                                   |
| deviceActivationFlows  | 30 min                                  |
| deviceActivations      | None                                    |
| deviceInstances        | None                                    |
| identityAuthority      | None                                    |
| deploymentAuthority    | None                                    |
| materializedAuthority  | None                                    |
| loginPortals           | None                                    |
| deploymentPortalRoutes | None                                    |
| services               | None                                    |
| connections            | 2h                                      |

## Deployment Checklist

Cluster-wide required state:

- SQLite auth/control-plane database (`storage.dbPath`)
- services tables
- sessions table
- RPC replay cache used by auth validators
- OAuth state store
- pending auth store
- device activation flow store
- device activation record store
- device instance store
- device deployment store
- identity authority and identity grant tables
- auth-owned login portal records, settings, and route selectors
- deployment authority and materialized authority tables, including device
  portal-route metadata
- connection store

Production requirements:

- TLS enabled
- NTP enabled for services
- auth callout deployed HA
- `auth_callout_error_allow = false`
- rate limiting configured

## Operational Concerns

- run multiple `trellis` auth-callout instances with shared KV state
- the `trellis` service is a critical dependency for all authenticated
  operations and must be deployed HA
- the `trellis` service requires `$SYS.ACCOUNT.TRELLIS.DISCONNECT` subscribe and
  `$SYS.REQ.SERVER.*.KICK` publish permissions
- no other services should receive broad `$SYS.*` access

Secrets that MUST NOT be logged:

- `authToken`
- NATS `auth_token` payload
- session key seeds
- RPC `proof` header

`sessionKey` itself may be logged because it is an identifier rather than a
credential.

## Connection Revocation Model

Connection revocation is performed by kicking live NATS clients, deleting
connection-presence KV state, and deleting SQL-backed sessions.

Illustrative behavior:

```ts
async function revokeSession(sessionKey: string) {
  const connections = await connectionsKv.keys(`${sessionKey}.*.*`);
  for await (const connKey of connections) {
    const { serverId, clientId } = await connectionsKv.get(connKey);
    await nc.request(
      `$SYS.REQ.SERVER.${serverId}.KICK`,
      JSON.stringify({ cid: clientId }),
    );
    await connectionsKv.delete(connKey);
  }

  await sessionsSql.deleteBySessionKey(sessionKey);
}
```

Kicking connections instead of revoking JWTs avoids account-JWT bloat.

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a production gate.

Minimum targets:

- the auth callout, per source IP or equivalent edge identity
- `/auth/requests`
- `/auth/login/:provider`
- `/auth/callback/:provider`
- `/auth/flow/:flowId`
- `/auth/flow/:flowId/approval`
- `/auth/flow/:flowId/bind`
- `/auth/devices/activate/wait`
- `/bootstrap/client`
- `/bootstrap/service`
- `/bootstrap/device`

Deployments should not go live without configured limits. HTTP auth limits must
use an address or edge identity supplied by the trusted runtime/proxy boundary;
client-controlled forwarding headers such as `x-forwarded-for` are not a safe
rate-limit identity by themselves.

## Key Rotation

### TRELLIS account signing key

1. Generate new key
2. Add it as an additional signing key
3. Push updated account JWT
4. Update the `trellis` service
5. Wait for JWT expiry
6. Remove the old key
7. Destroy old material

### Service session key

1. Generate new keypair
2. Register the new public key
3. Deploy the new seed
4. Remove the old key after rollout

### Auth callout signing and XKey material

1. Generate replacement account signing or XKey material
2. Update the configured seed files
3. Restart the Rust platform owner
4. Verify callout admission before destroying old material

Clients have no shared sentinel credential to rotate. Each bootstrap JWT is
bound to one session key and naturally expires with that session.

## Accepted Risks

### XSS Session Abuse

Risk: active XSS can invoke signing operations while the page is compromised.

Mitigations:

- non-extractable browser keys prevent key theft
- CSP and standard XSS mitigations remain primary defenses

Accepted because non-extractable keys still reduce blast radius compared with
extractable browser secrets.

## Non-Goals

- redefining the auth protocol or public auth API
- defining TypeScript or Rust package surfaces
