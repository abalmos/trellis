title: Rust Auth Service Ownership
description: TypeScript-to-Rust auth responsibility inventory and permanent cutover boundaries.

# Design: Rust Auth Service Ownership

## Purpose

The Rust `platform` subsystem is the sole runtime owner of external auth,
bootstrap, session, connection, and NATS Auth Callout behavior. The TypeScript
implementation remains only where this inventory identifies client or portal
source, generated vocabulary, or behavioral reference tests. It does not read,
write, proxy, validate, or fall back for Rust-owned auth state.

This inventory records the removed legacy implementation because product
behavior is preserved without preserving its storage or authority model. The
TypeScript runtime source and image were deleted after the cutover; the listed
paths are historical. The Rust service extends the accepted records and
materialization in `rust-authorization-state.md`; it does not introduce a
parallel auth subsystem.

Disposition meanings are:

- **migrate**: preserve the product behavior on Rust-owned state;
- **replace with clean Rust model**: preserve behavior while retiring the legacy
  storage or authority representation;
- **keep only as test reference**: no supported runtime registration remains;
- **intentionally retire**: the behavior or surface is not part of the Rust API;
- **defer**: the responsibility remains outside this cutover and cannot affect
  current authority.

## Ownership Inventory

Legacy paths were relative to the removed `ts/services/trellis` tree unless
stated otherwise.

## Runtime Cutover Rules

The Rust service uses one composition root after `platform.owner` acquisition:

```text
platform storage and migrations
  -> authorization/account/provisioning repositories
  -> shared domain services
  -> startup reconciliation and first-admin check
  -> auth flow and connection KV resources
  -> Auth Callout, RPC/operation/event, and HTTP adapters
  -> platform readiness
```

HTTP, RPC, operation, Auth Callout, and background paths call the same domain
services. Handlers do not execute SQL directly. Session creation, authority
acceptance, and connection kick each have one mutation path.

The TypeScript control-plane auth registration is disabled in supported
`platform` and `all` deployments. There is no shared database, dual write,
read-through, proxy, fallback, or concurrent callout responder.

## Implementation Architecture

### Source Artifacts And Generation

The Rust runtime crate owns two authored JSON inputs:

```text
rust/crates/runtime/trellis.api.json
rust/crates/runtime/trellis.participant.json
```

The first is the `trellis.auth@v1` `trellis.api.v1` artifact. The second is the
Rust auth runtime's `trellis.participant.v1` artifact. Repository preparation
discovers, lints, parses, and generates directly from these formats. It does not
convert them to or from native `trellis.api.v1` and `trellis.participant.v1`.

The API artifact owns public RPCs, operations, events, schemas, errors,
capability definitions, and consent metadata. Transitional request and event
validators are `internal: true` RPC definitions. The generator emits their typed
vocabulary only to private runtime adapters. They are absent from public Auth
clients and participant facades. Legacy native `trellis.api.v1` and
`trellis.participant.v1` Auth outputs are deleted rather than retained or
aliased.

The participant artifact implements the exact Auth API digest and declares the
runtime's built-in API uses, private consumers, queues, state, and resources.
Generated Rust and TypeScript artifacts derive from the same two authored files.
The legacy TypeScript Auth contract is not an alias or compatibility source.

Trellis-owned API artifacts are permanent entries in the platform catalog. An
exact built-in API ID and digest does not require deployed-service discovery
evidence when materializing authority. Participant needs and accepted grants
still determine which operations and capabilities a session receives. Runtime
startup and readiness own the availability of the subsystem implementing each
built-in API; service discovery remains authoritative only for deployed
service-owned APIs.

### Service Composition

`platform::auth` remains the only auth subsystem. It contains the accepted
authorization state and adds cohesive account, workflow, browser, bootstrap,
session, callout, HTTP, and RPC modules as their behavior is implemented. File
layout follows actual cohesion rather than pre-creating one file per planned
operation.

One cloneable `AuthService` composes:

- the existing authorization store and materialization service;
- account, workflow, and provisioning repository ports implemented by the same
  in-memory and SQLite stores;
- exact API and participant artifact lookup;
- short-lived flow, replay, and connection-presence KV ports;
- configured OAuth/OIDC provider clients;
- resource provisioning and binding resolution;
- NATS system connection control and canonical event publication.

HTTP, RPC, operation, callout, and background adapters call this service. They
do not execute SQL, reconstruct authority, or call one another over public
transport merely because they share a process.

### Durable Storage And Transactions

`V1002__auth_service_cutover.sql` adds companion records around the accepted
V1001 authority core. V1001 principals, provider links, participant bindings,
sessions, desired authority, deployments, instances, devices, delegations,
dependency/resource evidence, materialization, and authorization transition
outbox remain canonical.

V1002 adds only the missing product records:

- user profiles and local credentials;
- login portals, login settings, and portal routes;
- hashed single-use account flows;
- immutable authority proposal payloads and decision records;
- service and device provisioned identity metadata;
- hashed one-time device provisioning secrets;
- device activation review workflow records;
- bounded idempotency results for state-changing proof requests;
- one post-commit action outbox for normal events and deterministic connection
  kick intents not represented by the existing authorization transition outbox.

V1002 also normalizes accepted M7 deployment-authority keys to the deterministic
deployment + participant lineage and updates authority-keyed evidence and
materialization rows in the same migration. Proposal rows store normalized
deployment identity. Their semantic digest is unique only while pending;
terminal rows remain immutable history and may coexist with a later proposal of
the same semantics.

Repositories expose aggregate transactions rather than table-shaped CRUD. Local
registration, account-flow completion, browser bind/session creation, authority
acceptance, provisioning-secret consumption, activation decision, and session
revocation plus post-commit actions each have one atomic repository operation.
Every state-changing proof transaction atomically claims a key scoped by proof
purpose, authenticated principal or key, and request ID; compares the exact
request digest; performs the mutation; and stores the replayable result. Session
revocation inserts deterministic event and kick actions in that same
transaction. A critical dispatcher retries kick actions idempotently after
restart; kick failure cannot restore or roll back revocation.

Required-nullable values are required JSON members and SQL `NULL` when absent.

### Bootstrap And Connect Proofs

`trellis-protocol` owns explicit, length-prefixed proofs for user auth request
initiation and service/device bootstrap. Each proof binds its fixed domain and
version, canonical key identity, request ID, issued-at time, exact operation
fields, and canonical request digest. Service and device bootstrap bind both the
provisioned identity and newly generated session key.

Bootstrap returns a deny-all Auth-account JWT whose subject is the session key
encoded as a canonical NATS User NKey. Rust and TypeScript authenticators use
the session private key for the standard NATS challenge signature and send a
minimal auth token:

```json
{ "format": "trellis.nats-connect-token.v1", "contextDigest": "..." }
```

The callout validates the bootstrap JWT and standard NATS challenge, loads the
digest-selected signed context, and requires the generated NATS User NKey to
encode the same Ed25519 public key as `context.sessionKey`. There is no second
Trellis connect signature or generic connection replay state.

State-changing HTTP requests retain bounded durable idempotency results so a
matching request ID and digest can return the committed result after restart.
The claim and result are part of the business transaction, never a separate
best-effort write. The same ID with changed content fails.

Browser and OAuth scratch state remains in Trellis KV. A mutation-owning flow
step first CAS-claims the KV record with a claim ID and request digest, then
commits the same claim, mutation, and result in SQLite, then marks the KV record
completed or consumed. A retry observing a claim checks the durable result and
either completes the KV transition or safely resumes an uncommitted claim. It
never repeats a committed mutation.

OAuth state distinguishes `active`, `exchange_started`, `restart_required`, and
`completed`. Callback handling CAS-transitions to `exchange_started` before the
provider exchange. If the normalized provider identity and linked-account result
commit, retry completes from that durable result. If exchange began but no
durable result exists after interruption or unknown external outcome, the flow
becomes `restart_required` and requires a fresh provider authorization. Provider
codes and tokens are never replayed or persisted.

### HTTP Runtime

Auth routes merge into the existing Axum listener. The platform does not start a
second HTTP server. `platform::start` returns a platform startup result
containing its `SubsystemHandle` and an erased-state `Router<()>`. Subsystem
startup retains that platform-specific result instead of erasing it into the
ordinary handle list. The supervisor merges the platform router with health
routes before it starts the sole listener, only after all selected subsystems
are ready.

The platform owner exposes an acceptance/fence guard shared by the router and
store. V1002 stores the current owner ID and immutable NATS lease acquisition
fence in one singleton platform row. A successor replaces that row before it
starts auth work. Every auth write uses a bounded immediate SQLite transaction,
checks the expected persisted generation at start and immediately before commit,
and checks a conservative in-memory lease-valid-until deadline at both points.
Transactions refuse to start without enough remaining lease time for the fixed
maximum transaction duration and roll back if that budget is exhausted.

On ownership loss, the supervisor closes the guard, aborts the HTTP listener and
in-flight auth work without graceful mutation drain, aborts platform tasks, and
terminates the process. Graceful bounded HTTP drain applies only to ordinary
signal shutdown while ownership remains held. The persisted generation prevents
a stale process from committing after a successor has fenced the shared store;
the lease deadline prevents commits after the stale owner's last defensible
ownership window even before a successor opens the database.

The implementation uses established libraries for security-sensitive protocol
work:

- `oauth2` and `openidconnect` for OAuth/OIDC authorization code, PKCE,
  discovery, token, and ID-token behavior;
- RustCrypto `argon2` for Argon2id credentials and profile verification;
- `tower-http` for standard HTTP middleware;
- Axum body limits and an Axum-compatible governor middleware for bounded
  source-keyed rate limiting.

Origin, redirect, cookie, and flow-local checks remain explicit auth-domain
rules because generic CORS middleware cannot establish flow ownership. Public
errors contain no credentials, provider tokens, proofs, or internal storage
details.

### NATS Runtime

After `platform.owner` acquisition, platform startup opens the existing
Trellis-account client plus dedicated auth-account and system-account clients.
The Auth-account client owns only callout subscription and replies. The system
client owns only connection advisories and exact kick requests. The Trellis
client owns platform RPC/event subjects and Trellis KV resources.

Startup loads the configured callout issuer, target, and XKey seeds and reuses
the repository's established `nats-jwt-rs` and XKey-capable `nkeys` stack.
Before subscribing, it validates key types and verifies that the auth issuer key
matches the Auth account represented by auth credentials and that the target key
matches the Trellis account represented by Trellis credentials. Invalid or
mismatched material fails startup.

The callout performs:

```text
connect request
  -> proof and replay validation
  -> resolve_issuable_state
  -> exact artifact and binding lookup
  -> deterministic transport permission compilation
  -> expiry-bounded NATS user JWT
  -> sealed auth response
  -> operational connection presence
```

Permission compilation consumes only exact grant atoms, exact API descriptors,
structured resource bindings, the authoritative inbox prefix, and a narrow
participant-kind-dependent built-in list. Subjects, ACLs, current responders,
and physical resource names do not create permission atoms.

Auth Callout, disconnect watcher, outbox publisher, and reconciliation run as
critical platform tasks. Unexpected task completion or ownership loss stops all
auth acceptance and terminates the owning runtime through the existing
supervisor path.

### Portal Assets

The current Svelte portal remains the authored UI. Repository preparation builds
its static output reproducibly into generated artifacts. The Rust release binary
embeds that output, including content-hashed assets. SPA fallback applies only
beneath `/login/*` and `/console/*`; hashed asset misses and unknown
auth/bootstrap/API paths remain ordinary `404` responses. Production has no
source-tree or mounted asset dependency. A configured development override
directory may replace the embedded files without changing production behavior,
and canonical-path checks prevent traversal or symlink escape outside that
directory.

## Authority Replacement Rules

The following legacy data can inform behavior and tests but is never imported as
current machine authority:

- serialized session capability or subject snapshots;
- identity-grant subjects;
- capability-group objects or unresolved expansion;
- deployment grant overrides that expand authority;
- persisted NATS publish/subscribe ACLs;
- implementation-offer liveness without exact authority-scoped evidence;
- resource bucket, stream, consumer, or object-store names.

Current authority remains the accepted identity or deployment authority
projection defined in `rust-authorization-state.md`. Transport permissions are a
short-lived edge projection from issuable state, exact API descriptors, and
structured resource bindings.

## Trust And Context Integration Inventory

This appendix records the implemented trust/context boundary. Rust remains the
only runtime Auth owner; Rust and TypeScript providers verify ordinary requests
and events locally from Rust-authored protocol evidence.

### Issuance, Bootstrap, Persistence, And Consumption

TypeScript remains a supported client and service-provider implementation, not a
second authority engine. Client lifecycle code verifies and persists only its
own Rust-issued context through Rust/WASM, refreshes that context and route-only
JWT, reconnects, and projects browser/Svelte state. TypeScript service-provider
code keeps the same minimal connected registry state as the Rust provider and
delegates signed-object, request, and event cryptography to Rust/WASM.

| Client lifecycle      | Rust and TypeScript own only their current session/context persistence, refresh scheduling, route JWT renewal, reconnect, and terminal/transient state projection.                                                                                           |

### Authorization-Relevant Mutation Inventory

Rows below describe the current context selection and revocation coupling.
Implemented invalidations select affected active contexts in the same
authoritative SQLite transaction. SQLite is the sole complete persistence
implementation for trust, contexts, and revocations; in-memory auth fixtures do
not duplicate those semantics. Deterministic `context_revoke` post-commit
actions publish after commit; failure cannot roll back the domain mutation.

Context expiry remains the cryptographic upper bound. Registry revocation is
prompt distribution, not a source of broader authority. Profile display-name,
email/image changes, session last-seen coalescing, unrelated principals or
authorities, outbox retries, and semantic no-op reconciliation do not change an
issuance snapshot token and do not revoke contexts.
