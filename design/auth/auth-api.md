# Design: Auth API

## Prerequisites

- [trellis-auth.md](./trellis-auth.md) - auth architecture and identity
  authority model
- [auth-protocol.md](./auth-protocol.md) - proofs, connect tokens, and internal
  state rules

## Scope

This document defines the public Trellis auth API.

It covers:

- browser-flow broker, OAuth, and bind endpoints
- browser-flow APIs consumed by portals, including detached CLI/native login
- HTTP device activation endpoints
- public and admin `rpc.Auth.*` endpoints
- emitted auth events

It does not define language-specific client APIs.

Headings in this document use logical grouped resource-first names such as
`rpc.Auth.Devices.List`. The wire subjects remain versioned forms such as
`rpc.v1.Auth.Devices.List` and
`operations.v1.Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Resolve`.

Public names use the resource group before the action. Examples:

- `Auth.Deployments.Create`
- `Auth.Devices.List`
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.List`
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Get`
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Plans.List`
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Plans.Get`
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Plan`
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.AcceptUpdate`
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.AcceptMigration`
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Reject`
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Reconcile`

Shared browser-consent capability views use this shape:

```ts
type ContractConsentCapability = {
  displayName: string;
  description: string;
  consequence?: string;
};
```

## HTTP Endpoints

Browser auth endpoints:

- `POST /auth/requests`
- `GET /auth/login/:provider`
- `GET /auth/callback/:provider`
- `GET /auth/flow/:flowId`
- `POST /auth/flow/:flowId/register/local`
- `POST /auth/flow/:flowId/approval`
- `POST /auth/flow/:flowId/bind`
- `POST /auth/sessions/logout`

Global CORS behavior derives from `web.origins`:

- `web.origins: ["*"]` allows arbitrary browser origins without credentials.
  This is appropriate for public Trellis APIs where requests carry explicit
  Trellis proofs rather than ambient cookies.
- Specific `web.origins` entries allow only those configured origins and enable
  credentialed CORS for those origins.
- Flow-specific routes still perform stricter flow-local validation. Portal
  endpoints allow the selected portal origin for the flow. Bind allows only the
  app origin recorded when the flow was created from `redirectTo`. Credentialed
  routes such as OAuth callback state handling keep their stricter CORS/cookie
  rules.

Public Trellis URLs and public NATS/WebSocket transports should use HTTPS/WSS.
Loopback HTTP/WS remains valid for local development, and explicit
`web.allowInsecureOrigins` entries may permit other insecure public origins for
controlled deployments. Internal HTTP behind a trusted HTTPS reverse proxy is
still valid when the public browser-facing URL is secure.

Activated-device endpoints are defined in
[device-activation.md](./device-activation.md):

- `POST /auth/devices/activate/requests`
- `POST /auth/devices/activate/wait`
- `POST /auth/devices/connect-info`

`POST /auth/devices/activate/requests` validates the outbound device activation
payload, creates a short-lived auth-owned browser flow with
`kind: "device_activation"`, resolves the activation portal, and returns a short
`flowId`-based `activationUrl`. Portal resolution comes from the preregistered
device instance and deployment-owned portal-route metadata, with fallback to the
built-in Trellis device portal. Callers do not provide portal ids or profile ids
in the normal path.

### POST /auth/requests

Starts the normal auth flow for a contract-bearing user client such as a browser
app, CLI, or native app. The caller sends the initiating contract in the request
body so auth can either auto-complete reauth immediately or create an auth-owned
browser flow and return a short `flowId`-based login URL.

Request body:

| Name         | Required | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider`   | no       | Preferred provider id for direct provider continuation                                                                                                   |
| `redirectTo` | yes      | Post-login redirect URL                                                                                                                                  |
| `sessionKey` | yes      | Client public session key                                                                                                                                |
| `sig`        | yes      | `sign(hash("oauth-init:" + redirectTo + ":" + (provider ?? "") + ":" + canonicalJson(contract) + ":" + canonicalJson(context ?? null)))` by `sessionKey` |
| `contract`   | yes      | Initiating user-client contract manifest JSON for portal routing and consent planning                                                                    |
| `context`    | no       | Opaque JSON payload for app and portal coordination                                                                                                      |

Behavior:

1. Validate `redirectTo`
2. Verify `sig` by `sessionKey`
3. Validate the initiating contract and compute its digest
4. If an existing delegated user session for that `sessionKey` already covers
   the requested contract access, rebind immediately and return
   `status: "bound"`
5. Otherwise create an auth-owned browser flow record
6. Resolve login portal routing from auth-owned portal route selectors using app
   contract id and origin
7. Otherwise use the DB-projected built-in Trellis login portal served by the
   Trellis HTTP server
8. Return `status: "flow_started"` with `{ flowId, loginUrl }`

Rules:

- user-facing apps and tools send their contract manifest when they initiate
  login; they receive per-user consent during auth rather than being
  pre-installed like services
- app, CLI, and native auth may present a contract digest first; when auth does
  not know that digest it returns `manifest_required`, and the client retries
  with the full manifest for validation, digest verification, and flow storage
- bind later uses the contract already stored on the auth-owned browser flow
  rather than requiring the browser app to resubmit it
- if present, `context` is stored on the browser flow and returned to portals as
  app-owned opaque data
- a portal is trusted for this redirect only because auth-owned login portal
  routing selected it for the flow; portal routes do not by themselves grant
  delegated consent or service authority
- first login does not require pre-registering a portal because the built-in
  Trellis login portal is always available
- auth MAY apply a matching grant override for the app's contract id and origin;
  when one matches, or when existing identity authority already grants a strict
  superset of the requested access for the same app identity, auth may skip
  browser UX and return `bound` directly

### GET /auth/login/:provider

Initiates authentication for a configured provider for an existing browser flow,
usually after portal has chosen a provider.

Query parameters:

| Name     | Required | Description                                      |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `flowId` | yes      | Browser flow id created by `POST /auth/requests` |

Behavior:

1. Load the browser flow
2. Generate OAuth state and PKCE challenge
3. Store `{ provider, flowId, codeVerifier, createdAt }`
4. Set `trellis_oauth=state`
5. Redirect to the provider

Rules:

- the OAuth state cookie is `Secure` for HTTPS public origins
- loopback HTTP origins remain allowed without extra configuration for local
  development
- non-loopback HTTP public origins MUST be explicitly allowlisted with
  `web.allowInsecureOrigins`

### GET /auth/callback/:provider

Handles provider callback and returns control to portal for the next
browser-flow step.

Behavior:

1. Verify cookie matches `state`
2. Lookup and CAS-delete the pending OAuth state
3. Exchange code for tokens
4. Fetch user info
5. Provision or refresh the auth-local user projection
6. Generate `authToken`
7. Update the browser flow and pending auth state
8. Delete cookie
9. Redirect back into portal with `flowId` so portal can reload browser-flow
   state and follow the next server-generated redirect when appropriate

Rules:

- callback redirects preserve `flowId`; they do not need to carry `trellisUrl`
  in the default model because the selected portal deployment already has an
  explicit Trellis instance URL configuration
- if an OAuth/OIDC callback resolves to an unknown federated identity, Trellis
  may self-register it only when the selected login portal's effective policy
  allows federated registration and the provider is configured for the instance
- the selected login portal may further restrict federated providers; `null`
  means all configured providers are allowed, `[]` means none are allowed, and a
  non-empty list means only those configured provider ids may continue

### GET /auth/flow/:flowId

Returns machine-readable browser flow state for portal.

Response model:

```ts
type PortalFlowState =
  | {
    status: "choose_provider";
    flowId: string;
    // Effective providers after the selected portal policy is applied.
    providers: Array<{
      id: string;
      displayName: string;
    }>;
    app: {
      contractId: string;
      contractDigest: string;
      displayName: string;
      description: string;
      origin?: string;
      context?: unknown;
    };
    portal?: {
      portalId: string;
      displayName: string;
      entryUrl: string | null;
      builtIn: boolean;
      disabled: boolean;
      createdAt: string;
      updatedAt: string;
    };
    registration?: {
      localIdentity: { available: boolean };
      federatedIdentity: {
        available: boolean;
        providers: Array<{ id: string; displayName: string }>;
      };
    };
  }
  | {
    status: "approval_required";
    flowId: string;
    user: {
      origin: string;
      id: string;
      name?: string;
      email?: string;
      image?: string;
    };
    approval: {
      contractId: string;
      contractDigest: string;
      displayName: string;
      description: string;
      capabilities: Record<string, ContractConsentCapability>;
    };
  }
  | {
    status: "approval_denied";
    flowId: string;
    returnLocation?: string;
    approval: {
      contractId: string;
      contractDigest: string;
      displayName: string;
      description: string;
      capabilities: Record<string, ContractConsentCapability>;
    };
  }
  | {
    status: "insufficient_capabilities";
    flowId: string;
    approval: {
      contractId: string;
      contractDigest: string;
      displayName: string;
      description: string;
      capabilities: Record<string, ContractConsentCapability>;
    };
    missingCapabilities: string[];
    userCapabilities: string[];
  }
  | {
    status: "redirect";
    location: string;
  }
  | {
    status: "expired";
    returnLocation?: string;
  };
```

Rules:

- portal renders UX only from this auth-owned flow state
- custom portal libraries should use `flowId` as their browser URL state and
  call this endpoint to render auth state; they should not depend on
  provider-specific fragments or portal-local query conventions as protocol
  authority
- portal MUST treat `redirect.location` as an opaque next auth step
- `redirect.location` may point back to the originating browser app or to
  another auth-owned step in the same login flow
- `expired.returnLocation`, when present, is a safe app restart target for a
  known expired browser flow; portal helpers MAY treat it as an immediate
  redirect target rather than rendering an expiration screen
- when an expired flow is missing or has no `returnLocation`, portal MUST NOT
  invent an app return URL locally
- `approval_denied` is a fallback state for stored denied flow state; normal
  user denial returns `redirect` to the originating app with
  `authError=approval_denied`, and portal helpers MAY treat an
  `approval_denied.returnLocation` as an immediate redirect target
- for detached CLI/native login, `redirect.location` may resolve to the same
  portal login page; the built-in Trellis portal treats that same-page redirect
  as completion UX and tells the user to return to the Trellis CLI rather than
  redirecting again
- portal does not invent auth-protocol next-step URLs locally, though it may
  still use its own local routes and UI state while rendering the flow
- recoverable stale or expired auth states should restart the caller's normal
  auth request without a user-visible transient error screen when auth provides
  a safe redirect target
- portal-specific customization data travels through `app.context` rather than
  ad hoc query parameters between app and portal
- portal registration UI is gated by auth-owned flow state; clients MUST use
  `registration.localIdentity` and `registration.federatedIdentity` rather than
  inferring registration availability from provider lists or local UI defaults
- browser-visible `flowId` values are ULIDs; they are identifiers, not bearer
  secrets
- framework-neutral browser helpers and thin framework wrappers may hide the
  fetch and redirect plumbing, but exact helper declarations belong in the
  generated `/api` reference rather than in design docs

### POST /auth/flow/:flowId/register/local

Registers a local username/password identity for the selected browser login flow
and returns the next browser-flow state.

Local password credentials use Argon2id. The default minimum length is 12
characters; deployments may lower it only to the hard floor of 8. Trellis does
not impose composition rules, and the current implementation does not maintain a
PBKDF2 compatibility path for old hashes.

Request body:

```ts
{
  username: string;
  password: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

Rules:

- local self-registration is allowed only when the selected login portal's
  effective policy enables local registration and the instance-level
  `auth.localIdentity.enabled` gate is enabled
- the request body uses `name` and `email`; portals MUST NOT split this into
  `firstName` or `familyName` wire fields
- successful local registration creates the account, local identity, password
  credential, and pending browser auth state atomically for the active flow
- duplicate local usernames and unavailable local registration are expected
  caller-visible failures, not unexpected server errors
- duplicate local usernames return `409` with `error: "username_taken"`; email
  uniqueness is not enforced by this endpoint and portals MUST NOT infer an
  `email_taken` error

### POST /auth/flow/:flowId/approval

Accepts the portal consent decision for the contract attached to the browser
flow and returns the next `PortalFlowState`. The endpoint path is retained as a
public browser-flow URL shape.

Rules:

- the portal is not trusted as a service when it submits a consent decision
- auth trusts only the active browser flow identified by `flowId` and the
  server-owned state attached to that flow
- public portal helpers may expose decisions as `"approved" | "denied"`, but the
  HTTP request body remains the canonical boolean shape below
- `approved: true` persists the identity grant when no existing account-scoped
  identity authority or grant override already covers the request, then returns
  the normal redirect/bind continuation
- persisted consent reuse is scoped to the Trellis user account and app identity
  anchor; the current provider origin/subject is retained as audit evidence and
  is not the matching key
- `approved: false` does not persist a denied contract decision; it consumes the
  pending browser flow and returns a redirect to the caller's `redirectTo` with
  `authError=approval_denied`
- callers that receive `authError=approval_denied` SHOULD surface a denial
  result and clean the callback query parameters rather than immediately
  starting another sign-in flow
- expired provider-login continuations with a stored app `redirectTo` redirect
  directly to that app restart URL without adding `authError=flow_expired`;
  callers should treat the plain callback as a normal opportunity to restart the
  current auth request

Request:

```ts
{
  approved: boolean;
}
```

### POST /auth/flow/:flowId/bind

Binds a session key to an authenticated identity and approved contract digest
for the normal browser flow path.

Request:

```ts
{
  sessionKey: string;
  sig: string; // sign(hash("bind-flow:" + flowId))
}
```

Response:

```ts
type BindResponse =
  | {
    status: "bound";
    inboxPrefix: string;
    expires: string;
    sentinel: {
      jwt: string;
      seed: string;
    };
    transports: {
      native?: {
        natsServers: string[];
      };
      websocket?: {
        natsServers: string[];
      };
    };
  }
  | {
    status: "insufficient_capabilities";
    approval: {
      contractDigest: string;
      contractId: string;
      displayName: string;
      description: string;
      capabilities: Record<string, ContractConsentCapability>;
    };
    missingCapabilities: string[];
    userCapabilities: string[];
  };
```

Behavior:

1. Load the browser flow by `flowId`
2. Load the pending authenticated state already attached to that flow
3. Verify `sessionKey` and `sig`
4. Read the contract already associated with the pending login
5. Validate the contract, compute digest, derive required capabilities, and
   check identity authority
6. Reject the bind if the user projection is inactive
7. Consume the pending auth state
8. Create or recover the session record keyed by `sessionKey`
9. Persist delegated contract metadata and delegated publish/subscribe subjects
   into the session
10. Compute `inboxPrefix = _INBOX.${sessionKey.slice(0, 16)}`
11. Refresh the Trellis-local auth projection entry without overwriting
    admin-managed `active` state or granted capabilities
12. Return the bind response with `inboxPrefix`, `expires`, `sentinel`, and
    `transports`

Rules:

- normal browser and detached CLI/native flows bind only through the auth-owned
  browser flow after Trellis has already recorded a consent decision
- flow bind still rechecks identity authority and capabilities defensively
- portal is a browser UX surface only; bind remains auth-owned

### POST /auth/sessions/logout

Terminates a browser session from the app side without relying on the active
NATS app connection. Browser clients sign the logout intent with the session key
and send it directly to Trellis HTTP.

Request:

```ts
{
  sessionKey: string;
  iat: number;
  sig: string; // sign(hash("logout-session:" + canonicalLogoutPayload))
  providerLogout?: boolean;
  federatedProviderLogout?: boolean;
  returnTo?: string;
  responseMode?: "json" | "redirect";
}
```

JSON response:

```ts
{
  success: true;
  redirectTo?: string;
}
```

Behavior:

1. Parse and validate the JSON body
2. Require a fresh `iat`
3. Verify `sig` by `sessionKey` over the canonical logout payload
4. Lookup the session by `sessionKey`
5. Validate `returnTo`, when supplied
6. If `providerLogout` is true for a user session, build an upstream provider
   logout URL when the session provider supports one
7. Delete the Trellis session
8. Kick all matching live NATS connections and delete connection entries
9. Return `{ success: true, redirectTo? }` for JSON mode, or redirect with 303
   for redirect mode when a redirect target exists

Rules:

- valid `returnTo` values must be HTTP(S) and must match the bound app origin
  for app-bound user sessions; sessions without an app origin may use explicit
  configured `web.origins`
- wildcard `web.origins` entries do not authorize logout return targets
- apps cannot provide arbitrary external return URLs
- provider logout is optional and best-effort: unsupported providers, missing
  provider metadata, and provider URL construction failures still complete
  Trellis session revocation unless the requested return URL itself is invalid
- `redirectTo`, when returned, is the upstream provider logout URL when provider
  logout is available, otherwise the validated `returnTo`
- browser apps should use Trellis browser auth helpers for this endpoint and
  clear local browser session-key storage before navigating away

## Identity Authority RPCs

### rpc.Auth.IdentityGrants.List

Request:

```ts
{
  user?: string;
  offset?: number;
  limit: number;
}
```

Response:

```ts
type AuthIdentityGrantRow = {
  user: string;
  answer: "approved" | "denied";
  answeredAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  identityGrantId: string;
  identityAnchor:
    | { kind: "web"; contractId: string; origin: string }
    | { kind: "cli"; contractId: string; sessionPublicKey: string }
    | { kind: "native"; contractId: string; sessionPublicKey: string }
    | { kind: "device-user"; contractId: string; devicePublicKey: string };
  presentedContract: {
    contractDigest: string;
    contractId: string;
  };
  displayName: string;
  description: string;
  capabilities: Record<string, ContractConsentCapability>;
  participantKind: "app" | "agent";
};

{
  entries: AuthIdentityGrantRow[];
  count: number;
  offset: number;
  limit: number;
  nextOffset?: number;
}
```

Callers without `admin` see only their own identity grants.

Identity grants are account-scoped: linked local and OIDC identities on the same
Trellis user account see and reuse the same grants for the same app identity
anchor. `contractDigest` and the provider identity that created the grant are
evidence metadata, not reuse keys.

List RPCs use the standard live offset page shape. Requests are
`{ offset?: number; limit: number }` plus documented filters. Responses are
`{ entries, count, offset, limit, nextOffset? }`. This is live offset
pagination, not snapshot or cursor pagination: concurrent inserts or deletes can
change which rows appear at later offsets. `limit` is required, `offset` is
optional and defaults to the first row, and implementations MUST apply any
filters in the database query before applying the bound.

### rpc.Auth.IdentityGrants.Revoke

Request:

```ts
{
  identityGrantId: string;
  user?: string;
}
```

Response:

```ts
{
  success: boolean;
}
```

Revocation removes the addressed identity grant, revokes matching active
delegated sessions, and removes reconnect authority until a new consent decision
creates an identity grant again. `contractDigest` is evidence metadata, not the
revocation key.

## Authenticated User RPCs

These RPCs require `session-key` and `proof` headers. The contract digest is
authenticated during connect, bootstrap, or session binding and is resolved for
each request from stored session/principal state rather than from a per-request
header.

The following self-service auth RPCs intentionally require no granted
capabilities beyond successful authenticated user context:

- `rpc.Auth.Sessions.Me`
- `rpc.Auth.Sessions.Logout`
- `rpc.Auth.Users.IdentityLink.Create`
- `rpc.Auth.Users.Password.Change`
- `rpc.Auth.Users.Resolve`

### rpc.Auth.Sessions.Logout

Request:

```ts
{}
```

Response:

```ts
{
  success: boolean;
}
```

Behavior:

1. Validate headers
2. Lookup session
3. Delete the Trellis session
4. Kick matching live NATS connections for the caller scope
5. Delete matching connection entries
6. Return `{ success: true }`

`Auth.Sessions.Logout` is terminal Trellis session logout for the authenticated
RPC caller. It does not carry browser/provider logout metadata and does not
construct provider logout URLs. Browser apps that need provider logout use
`POST /auth/sessions/logout` instead.

Rules:

- callers may send `{}`; extra request fields are reserved for additive schema
  evolution and are ignored by the terminal logout behavior
- provider logout is intentionally not modeled on this RPC because the active
  app connection may be terminated by the logout itself

Digest changes are handled by restarting the normal auth request flow with the
current contract body. Runtime reconnect auth is regenerated locally from
`sessionKey + contractDigest + iat + sig`; auth does not issue renewable binding
tokens.

### rpc.Auth.Sessions.Me

Request:

```ts
{}
```

Response:

```ts
{
  participantKind: "app" | "agent" | "service" | "device";
  user: {
    userId: string;
    active: boolean;
    email: string;
    name: string;
    image?: string;
    capabilities: string[];
    identity: {
      identityId: string;
      provider: string;
      subject: string;
    };
    lastLogin?: string;
  } | null;
  device: {
    type: "device";
    deviceId: string;
    deviceType: string;
    runtimePublicKey: string;
    deploymentId: string;
    capabilities: string[];
    active: boolean;
  } | null;
  service: {
    type: "service";
    id: string;
    name: string;
    capabilities: string[];
    active: boolean;
  } | null;
}
```

Rules:

- this is a zero-capability authenticated self-service RPC
- user sessions receive user identity authority context and null device/service
  entries
- device sessions receive device materialized authority context and, when
  available, the activating user in `user`
- service sessions receive service materialized authority context and null
  user/device entries

### rpc.Auth.Users.Resolve

Request:

```ts
{
  userIds: string[];
}
```

Response:

```ts
{
  users: Array<{
    userId: string;
    displayName?: string;
    email?: string;
  }>;
  missing?: string[];
}
```

Rules:

- this is a zero-capability authenticated RPC for resolving explicit user ids
  that an app or service already saw on records it is authorized to read
- the RPC is not a directory; unknown ids are returned in `missing`, duplicate
  inputs are collapsed, and there is no search or page/list behavior
- only minimal label fields are returned; broader profile and directory access
  remains behind `Auth.Users.List`/admin surfaces

### rpc.Auth.Requests.Validate

Request:

```ts
{
  sessionKey: string;
  proof: string;
  subject: string;
  payloadHash: string;
  iat: number;
  requestId: string;
  capabilities?: string[];
}
```

Response:

```ts
type CallerView =
  | {
    type: "user";
    participantKind: "app" | "agent";

This RPC is the capability and session lookup service used by other Trellis
services. The caller shape is a union because users and devices all share the
same post-auth authorization pipeline.

The `proof` covers the session key, request subject, raw payload hash, corrected
`iat`, and `requestId`. Empty proof, session, subject, payload-hash, request-id,
or capability strings are invalid. `payloadHash` is the hash of the raw request
body computed by the receiving service; callers do not get to override it with a
trusted header. Validation uses a replay cache keyed by session and request id.
The proof does not include `contractDigest`; validation resolves contract
context, principal identity, and capabilities from the authenticated session
state that was created at connect, bootstrap, or session binding time.

`Auth.Requests.Validate` is a baseline auth surface for service runtimes.
Trellis may make it available to services automatically, without requiring every
service contract to declare an explicit auth `uses` entry for this RPC.

## Device Activation And Deployment Authority Public Surface

Detailed activation flow semantics, event ordering, and confirmation-code
behavior are defined in [device-activation.md](./device-activation.md). This
section defines the canonical public API shapes that other auth docs refer to.

Public auth-owned surfaces:

- HTTP endpoints `POST /auth/devices/activate/requests`,
  `POST /auth/devices/activate/wait`, and `POST /auth/devices/connect-info`
- operation subject `operations.v1.Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Resolve`
- grouped deployment, deployment-authority, service-instance, device-instance,
  and device lifecycle admin RPCs under `rpc.v1.Auth.*`
- event subjects `events.v1.Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Requested`,
  `events.v1.Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Approved`,
  `events.v1.Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Resolved`, and
  `events.v1.Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.ReviewRequested`

Deployment authority RPCs:

- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.List` pages deployment-owned desired authority.
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Get` returns desired deployment authority plus the
  current materialized authority view, portal routing, and grant overrides.
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Plan` derives a contract proposal from the presented
  contract, compares it with desired authority, and returns either an authority
  update or an authority migration plan, including incompatible same-contract
  replacement plans.
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Plans.List` pages pending and historical authority
  plans with optional deployment, state, classification, and kind filters.
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Plans.Get` returns one pending or historical
  authority plan.
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.AcceptUpdate` accepts only plans classified as
  `"update"`, mutates desired state, and schedules reconciliation after commit.
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.AcceptMigration` accepts only plans classified as
  `"migration"`, requires explicit admin acknowledgement, and mutates desired
  state before scheduling reconciliation after commit.
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Reject` rejects a pending plan without mutating
  desired or materialized authority.
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.Reconcile` is an admin-triggered convergence request
  that materializes desired state into resources, bindings, and runtime grants.
- `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.GrantOverrides.Put` replaces all grant override rows
  for one deployment. `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.GrantOverrides.List` pages grant
  override rows across deployments.
  `Auth.DeploymentAuthority.GrantOverrides.Remove` removes exact matching rows.
  Mutations return the deployment's current grant override rows.

Rules:

- `ContractProposal.requestedNeeds` and `DeploymentAuthority.desiredState.needs`
  are grouped by `contracts`, `surfaces`, `capabilities`, and `resources`
- `MaterializedAuthority.grants` is grouped by `capabilities`, `surfaces`, and
  `nats`; it is a reconciled projection, not desired authority
- accepting an authority update or authority migration approves desired
  authority changes, including resulting resource definition changes, and
  schedules reconciliation after the desired-state commit
- authority plans include pending requests and accepted, rejected, expired, or
  superseded history; pending plans are actionable only while they target the
  current deployment authority version, and newer pending plans for the same
  deployment contract supersede older unanswered plans; auto-accepted
  `mutable-dev` same-contract replacement migrations remain visible with a
  recorded decision timestamp and auto-approval reason
- `AuthorityPlan.breakingChanges` is the authoritative structured list of
  concrete compatibility failures for operator UI
- `BreakingChange.path` is a JSON Pointer into the target when the verifier can
  localize the breakage; schema targets are preferred over generic
  `digest-incompatible` entries when a named schema is known
- reconciliation is the only path that creates, updates, removes, adopts, or
  purges materialized resources and bindings
- runtime bootstrap receives only current materialized authority where
  `materializedAuthority.status === "current"` and
  `materializedAuthority.desiredVersion === authority.version`; if desired
  authority is accepted but not yet materialized, bootstrap waits or retries
- stale or obsolete persisted materialized-authority projections are repaired by
  Trellis storage upgrade and reconciliation; repaired rows are not runtime
  permissions until they are current for the deployment authority version
- service and device deployment enable/disable mutations validate against staged
  deployment authority because enabled desired state determines what can later
  be materialized
- deployment authority mutations fail closed when required `uses` dependencies
  are unknown or cannot be resolved from effective active contracts or the
  latest accepted dependency fallback
- runtime credentials use materialized `nats` grants from current materialized
  authority instead of recomputing subjects from active contracts during
  auth-callout
- service and device deployment removal may skip `uses` validation so operators
  can tear down an already-broken graph instead of being trapped by stale
  dependencies
- if a same-`contractId` digest is incompatible with the deployment's latest
  accepted digest or offer, auth classifies the replacement as an authority
  migration. Under `strict`, auth records a pending migration plan and waits for
  explicit admin acceptance. Under `mutable-dev`, auth records the same
  migration plan, auto-accepts it with an auto-approval decision, mutates
  desired authority, and schedules reconciliation.
- missing optional dependency contracts or optional requested surfaces are
  absent from the contract proposal and grant no authority; if they later become
  active, a fresh plan is required before a reconnect can use that optional
  authority
- the successful service bootstrap response includes the materialized resource
  binding payload for the presented digest; service runtimes use that binding to
  initialize KV, store, jobs, and transfer helpers without requiring a
  post-connect discovery RPC call from the service principal

Portal rules:

- Trellis always provides built-in login and generic device-activation portal
  routes; they are commonly served by the Trellis HTTP server from static assets
  and the built-in login portal is represented as a visible, non-deletable
  auth-owned portal record
- login portal records, policy, and route selection live in auth-owned projected
  storage and are exposed through `Auth.Portals.*` admin RPCs; device-activation
  portal routing remains deployment-owned unless its design explicitly changes
- non-built-in login portal records can be created or updated through
  `Auth.Portals.Put`; the built-in login portal remains visible and
  non-deletable and cannot be replaced by a portal upsert
- non-built-in login portal records can be removed through `Auth.Portals.Remove`
  only when no login route targets them; built-in portal records cannot be
  removed
- login portal settings include `allowedFederatedProviders: string[] | null`;
  `null` allows every configured OAuth/OIDC provider, `[]` allows no federated
  providers, and an array allows only that configured subset
- `Auth.Portals.Get` returns the portal record, login settings, portal-scoped
  routes, default grants, and `federatedProviders` for admin display of
  configured provider ids, display names, and provider types; it does not expose
  provider secrets or mutate provider configuration
- custom portal apps should use explicit Trellis URL config rather than
  same-origin inference
- portal routing metadata does not imply consent, capabilities, or availability;
  delegated access comes from identity authority, deployment authority, and
  grant overrides
- custom portals remain first-class browser apps, but there is no
  portal-specific contract kind or portal-specific auth machinery
- if a portal later calls Trellis after bind, it does so as a normal
  user-authenticated browser app contract rather than through portal-specific
  contract handling
- portals MUST NOT use service deployment authority as their trust model

Portal routing rules:

- login flows resolve portal routing from auth-owned selectors in this order:
  contract id plus origin, contract id, origin, global default, built-in login
  portal fallback
- device activation resolves portal routing from deployment-owned device portal
  metadata, then falls back to the built-in Trellis device portal
- for login routes, the built-in login portal has the explicit id
  `trellis.builtin.login`
- the built-in device activation portal is a Trellis-owned app contract with the
  id `trellis.portal.activation@v1`
- custom login portals must have a visible portal record before a login route
  can target them
- route keys are selector-derived RPC identity for one `contractId + origin`
  selector; operator UI should present routes as app/contract selectors owned by
  each portal instead of as a global route inventory
- adding a portal-scoped route for a selector already targeting another portal
  is rejected rather than silently moving the selector
- most deployments can rely on the built-in portal; custom routing is optional

Library rule:

- public client libraries MAY wrap these HTTP and RPC surfaces with higher-level
  browser-flow, portal, admin, service, and device-activation helpers, but those
  helpers MUST preserve these canonical wire shapes and the
  `Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Resolve` operation model
- exact TypeScript helper declarations belong in the generated `/api` reference;
  exact Rust helper declarations belong in Rustdoc

Device-activation observation rule:

- portal-side review state is observed through normal operation `progress`,
  `watch()`, and `wait()` semantics on `Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Resolve`, not
  through a separate status-poll RPC
- when `Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Reviews.Decide` approves or rejects a review,
  it completes the original device-user authority operation durably; retrying
  the decision is accepted only when the existing completed operation output
  matches the requested terminal result

Capability rule:

- review-decision RPCs MUST allow callers with `admin` or
  `trellis.auth::device.review`
- grant overrides are deployment metadata, not user-owned grants; user-facing
  callers still see only explicit user capabilities in insufficient-capability
  responses
- deployment grant override consent applies only when matching grant overrides
  themselves cover the required capabilities; user capabilities do not turn a
  grant override into deployment-owned authority
- portal routes, defaults, selections, and registration settings do not imply
  consent, service authority, or capability grants; registration availability is
  reported explicitly in browser-flow state

## Admin RPCs

Admin RPCs require the `admin` capability unless explicitly documented
otherwise. Device review decision RPCs are the current exception and also allow
`trellis.auth::device.review`.

Admin list RPCs are bounded production queries using the standard live offset
page shape. Requests are `{ offset?: number; limit: number }` plus documented
filters. Responses are `{ entries, count, offset, limit, nextOffset? }`. This is
live offset pagination, not snapshot or cursor pagination: concurrent inserts or
deletes can change which rows appear at later offsets. Admin list RPCs MUST NOT
expose an unbounded "list all" mode.

### rpc.Auth.Sessions.List

Request:

```ts
{
  user?: string;
  offset?: number;
  limit: number;
}
```

Response:

```ts
type AuthSessionRow =
  | {
      key: string;
      sessionKey: string;
      participantKind: "app" | "agent";
      principal: {
        type: "user";
        userId: string;
        name: string;
        identity: { identityId: string; provider: string; subject: string };
      };
      contractId: string;
      contractDisplayName: string;
      createdAt: string;
      lastAuth: string;
    }
  | {
      key: string;
      sessionKey: string;
      participantKind: "device";
      principal: {
        type: "device";
        deviceId: string;
        deviceType: string;
        deploymentId: string;
        runtimePublicKey: string;
      };
      contractId: string;
      contractDisplayName?: string;
      createdAt: string;
      lastAuth: string;
    }
  | {
      key: string;
      sessionKey: string;
      participantKind: "service";
      principal: {
        type: "service";
        id: string;
        instanceId: string;
        deploymentId: string;
        name: string;
      };
      createdAt: string;
      lastAuth: string;
    };

{
  entries: AuthSessionRow[];
  count: number;
  offset: number;
  limit: number;
  nextOffset?: number;
}
```

### rpc.Auth.Users.List

Request:

```ts
{
  offset?: number;
  limit: number;
}
```

Response:

```ts
type AuthUserRow = {
  userId: string;
  name?: string;
  email?: string;
  active: boolean;
  capabilities: string[];
  capabilityGroups: string[];
  identities: Array<{
    identityId: string;
    provider: string;
    subject: string;
    displayName: string | null;
    email: string | null;
    emailVerified: boolean;
    linkedAt: string;
    lastLoginAt: string | null;
  }>;
};

{
  entries: AuthUserRow[];
  count: number;
  offset: number;
  limit: number;
  nextOffset?: number;
}
```

`Auth.Users.Create` uses the same account fields except `userId` and
`identities`: callers may supply `name`, `email`, `active`, direct
`capabilities`, `capabilityGroups`, and optional `username`; Trellis always
generates the canonical `userId`. When `username` is present, Trellis atomically
creates the account and its initial local username identity. Each Trellis
account may have at most one local username/password identity; it may have many
linked OIDC identities.

Trellis-generated user ids use the `usr_` prefix followed by a ULID. If local
username creation fails because the username already belongs to another local
identity, `Auth.Users.Create` returns an `AuthError` with
`reason: "username_taken"` and a human-readable message. Generated user-id
collisions are unexpected internal failures, not user-actionable form errors.

Admin bootstrap creates or reuses the initial local `admin` account and local
identity before issuing a password-reset URL for that identity. Bootstrap admin
accounts assign the built-in `admin` group by storing
`capabilityGroups: ["admin"]`; they do not copy the admin group's current
capabilities into the account's direct `capabilities` grant. Older accounts may
still carry direct `"admin"` grants; authorization resolves both direct
capabilities and assigned groups.

### rpc.Auth.Capabilities.List

Request:

```ts
{
  offset?: number;
  limit: number;
}
```

Response:

```ts
type AuthCapabilityRow = {
  key: string;
  displayName: string;
  description: string;
  consequence?: string;
  source: "contract" | "platform";
  contractId?: string;
  contractDigest?: string;
  contractDisplayName?: string;
};

{
  entries: AuthCapabilityRow[];
  count: number;
  offset: number;
  limit: number;
  nextOffset?: number;
}
```

Rules:

- `Auth.Capabilities.List` returns the assignment catalog known to the current
  auth runtime: Trellis platform capabilities plus capability metadata projected
  into authority-owned capability definitions when deployment authority is
  planned or accepted. Durable deployment authority and identity authority
  remain the authority sources.
- The response is an assignment catalog for admin UX; it is not a grant source
  by itself.
- Capability keys are canonical global keys such as
  `trellis.auth::device.review`; contract-owned keys originate from declared
  top-level capability metadata, while platform keys are explicitly defined by
  Trellis.

### rpc.Auth.Users.Update

Request:

```ts
{
  userId: string;
  active?: boolean;
  capabilities?: string[];
  capabilityGroups?: string[];
  name?: string;
  email?: string;
}
```

Response:

```ts
{
  success: boolean;
}
```

Rules:

- `capabilities`, when present, replaces the user's explicit capability grants
  with the exact canonical keys supplied by the admin caller.
- `capabilityGroups`, when present, replaces the user's assigned dynamic group
  keys. Groups are resolved at authorization time; direct capabilities are kept
  as explicit per-user grants.
- Unknown or uncataloged existing capability strings may remain on a user
  record, but new Trellis-owned assignments SHOULD use keys returned by
  `Auth.Capabilities.List`.

### rpc.Auth.Users.IdentityLink.Create

Request:

```ts
{}
```

Response:

```ts
{
  flowId: string;
  url: string;
  expiresAt: string;
}
```

Rules:

- this is a self-service authenticated-user RPC with no capability requirement
- the flow always targets the caller's own `userId`
- callers cannot pass another account id or provider filters
- the returned `url` is intended for clients such as the Console profile to open
  the account-link flow directly; users should not need to copy a generated link
  by hand
- the returned `flowId` is a ULID
- completing the flow may add another OIDC identity to the account
- completing a local username/password link is allowed only when the target
  account has no existing local identity
- admins may view and unlink user identities through management surfaces, but do
  not generate identity-link URLs for other users

### rpc.Auth.Users.Password.Change

Request:

```ts
{
  currentPassword: string;
  newPassword: string;
}
```

Response:

```ts
{
  success: boolean;
}
```

Rules:

- this is a self-service authenticated-user RPC with no capability requirement
- the target is always the caller's own `userId`; callers cannot pass another
  account id
- the target account must have exactly one local identity and an existing local
  credential
- Trellis verifies `currentPassword` against the existing local credential
  before replacing it with `newPassword`
- successful password change revokes other active sessions for the target user
  when session storage is available, while preserving the caller's current
  session when the RPC context includes `sessionKey`

### rpc.Auth.Users.PasswordReset.Create

Request:

```ts
{
  userId: string;
  expiresInSeconds?: number;
}
```

Response:

```ts
{
  flowId: string;
  url: string;
  expiresAt: string;
}
```

Rules:

- this is an admin RPC and requires the `admin` capability
- the flow targets the supplied `userId`
- the returned `flowId` is a ULID
- the target user must already have exactly one local identity; reset creation
  fails rather than allowing the link holder to choose a username
- the same durable flow kind covers first-time credential setup for an existing
  local identity and later password reset
- completion is local-provider only and creates or replaces the bound local
  identity's credential
- successful completion revokes active sessions for the target user
- `expiresInSeconds` is bounded by auth policy; omitted values use the default
  account-flow TTL

### rpc.Auth.CapabilityGroups.*

Capability groups are admin-managed dynamic authorization inputs. Assigning a
group stores the group key on the user account; it does not copy the group's
current capabilities into the user's direct grants. The built-in `admin` group
is read-only in management surfaces, but can be assigned to users.

`Auth.CapabilityGroups.Put` accepts only capability keys returned by
`Auth.Capabilities.List`, including Trellis platform keys and
authority-projected contract capability definitions. Requests that include
uncataloged capability strings fail with `invalid_request` instead of preserving
or creating hidden grants.

Admin UX SHOULD make the distinction visible: capabilities provided by selected
groups should appear resolved for review but should not be editable as direct
grants unless the group is removed from the user.

### rpc.Auth.Sessions.Revoke

Request:

```ts
{
  sessionKey: string;
}
```

Response:

```ts
{
  success: boolean;
}
```

## Emitted Events

Trellis publishes these events as part of `trellis.auth@v1`:

- `events.v1.Auth.Connections.Opened`
- `events.v1.Auth.Connections.Closed`
- `events.v1.Auth.Sessions.Revoked`
- `events.v1.Auth.Connections.Kicked`
- `events.v1.Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Requested`
- `events.v1.Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.ReviewRequested`
- `events.v1.Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Approved`
- `events.v1.Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Resolved`

Services may subscribe only when the presented contract fits materialized
authority and declares the events in grouped `uses.required` or `uses.optional`
entries that are active and authorized.

## Non-Goals

- defining the proof/signature protocol
- defining TypeScript or Rust helper packages
- deployment/runbook guidance
