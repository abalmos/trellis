# State Patterns

`State` is the Trellis-managed API for semi-durable contract-owned state that
should be available across authenticated app and device sessions.

## Purpose

- provide cloud-backed contract state similar to app-local preferences or drafts
- preserve state across upgrades within one contract lineage
- keep raw KV resources service-owned while exposing a Trellis-owned public
  state surface to normal callers

`State` is not a replacement for service-owned `resources.kv`. Services that
need private projections or internal checkpoints should continue to use
schema-backed `resources.kv` directly through `service.kv.<alias>` or injected
handler `client.kv.<alias>` stores.

## Contract Model

The public state model is a top-level contract `state` declaration.

Each declared store is named and schema-backed:

- the contract declares `state.<storeName>`
- each store requires `kind: "value" | "map"`
- each store requires `schema: { schema: "SchemaName" }`
- the referenced schema must exist in the contract's top-level `schemas` map
- each store may declare `stateVersion`; it defaults to `"v1"`
- each store may declare `acceptedVersions`, a map of older author-known state
  versions to schemas that the current runtime can read for migration
- the declared store metadata drives both emitted manifest content and typed
  runtime facades

Example:

```ts
const contract = defineAppContract(
  {
    schemas: {
      Preferences: Type.Object({ theme: Type.String() }),
      Preferences: Type.Object({
        theme: Type.String(),
        compact: Type.Boolean(),
      }),
      Draft: Type.Object({ title: Type.String() }),
    },
  },
  (ref) => ({
    id: "acme.notes@v1",
    displayName: "Notes",
    description: "Notes app",
    uses: [state({
      preferences: {
        kind: "value",
        schema: ref.schema("Preferences"),
        stateVersion: "preferences.v2",
        acceptedVersions: {
          "preferences.v1": ref.schema("Preferences"),
        },
      },
      drafts: { kind: "map", schema: ref.schema("Draft") },
    })],
  }),
);
```

## Store Kinds

### `kind: "value"`

A value store holds one value for the authenticated caller and contract.

- no public key argument
- runtime helpers are `get()`, `put(value, opts?)`, and `delete(opts?)`

Typical use cases:

- preferences
- selected workspace
- last-viewed item

### `kind: "map"`

A map store holds many values under caller-provided keys for the authenticated
caller and contract.

- public key argument is required for `get`, `put`, and `delete`
- `list(...)` is available only on map stores
- `prefix(path)` creates a narrowed map-store view rooted at that path

Typical use cases:

- drafts
- per-document UI state
- cached records keyed by id

## Ownership And Boundary

- `State` is a Trellis-owned contract surface
- v1 is implemented by the Rust Platform owner; it is not a separate runtime
  subsystem or process
- backing storage is the single Trellis-owned internal `trellis_state` KV bucket
- normal callers use contract-declared stores, not raw buckets or raw subjects

This mirrors the `Files` boundary: the public API is contract-owned and the
storage backing remains an implementation detail.

## Normal Runtime Surface

The normal client/device runtime exposes declared stores at
`client.state.<store>`. The `state(...)` descriptor privately selects the
Trellis-owned `State.*` transport actions needed by this named-store facade.

Example:

```ts
const preferences = await client.state.preferences.get();

const created = await client.state.preferences.put(
  { theme: "dark" },
  { expectedRevision: null },
);

const activeDrafts = client.state.drafts.prefix("inspection/active");
const page = await activeDrafts.list({ limit: 20 });
for (const draft of page.entries) {
  console.log(draft.key, draft.value.title);
}
```

Rules:

- the store name comes from the contract's `state({...})` feature selection
- supporting `State.*` RPCs are private runtime details; the named-store facade
  is the public runtime entrypoint
- normal callers do not provide `contractId`, `scope`, user identity, or device
  identity
- the runtime derives the target namespace from the authenticated session and
  the contract id/lineage plus authenticated principal, so state follows
  compatible app or device upgrades within the same lineage
- the active `contractDigest` validates the declaration and schema used for the
  current request; it is not the durable state namespace component
- stored entries carry the writer's internal contract digest and the
  author-known `stateVersion` that wrote the entry
- adding optional schema fields may change the contract digest without changing
  `stateVersion`; the current schema must still accept existing entries
- incompatible persisted-state changes should increment `stateVersion` and add
  the previous version under `acceptedVersions`
- there is no public normal-client generic keyspace API and no public normal-
  client `scope` parameter
- exact TypeScript client type declarations, option shapes, result unions, and
  method signatures belong in the generated TypeScript API reference under
  `/api`

## State Versioning And Migration

Contract digests are runtime artifact identities and are not author-facing state
migration keys. Contract authors use `stateVersion` to describe the logical
persisted shape of one named store.

Rules:

- keep `stateVersion` unchanged for compatible additive changes, such as adding
  optional fields that the current schema accepts
- increment `stateVersion` only when existing stored values are no longer valid
  or semantically sufficient for the current runtime
- declare each readable older version in `acceptedVersions`
- every `acceptedVersions` schema reference must exist in the contract's
  top-level `schemas` map
- Trellis validates older entries against the accepted version schema and
  returns a migration-required result; it does not run app migration code
  server-side
- client runtime code is responsible for transforming old values and writing the
  migrated current value back with revision checks
- stored entries MUST include `stateVersion` and internal
  `writerContractDigest`; v1 Trellis rejects unstamped pre-v1 entries instead of
  treating them as current or inferring declared `acceptedVersions`

## Conditional Writes

Conditional writes use `put(..., { expectedRevision })`.

- omit `expectedRevision` for unconditional create-or-overwrite
- use `expectedRevision: null` for create-if-absent
- use `expectedRevision: "<revision>"` for update-if-current-revision-matches
- `delete(..., { expectedRevision })` supports delete-if-current-revision-
  matches

There is no separate normal-client compare-and-set API in the named-store model.

## Public Entry Model

State entries are JSON values plus Trellis-managed revision metadata.

Value-store entry shape:

- `value`
- `revision`
- `updatedAt`
- `expiresAt?`

Migration-required entry shape:

- `migrationRequired: true`
- `entry` with the old value and normal entry metadata
- `stateVersion` of the stored value
- `currentStateVersion` of the current store declaration
- `writerContractDigest` for internal provenance and auditing

Map-store entry shape:

- `key`
- `value`
- `revision`
- `updatedAt`
- `expiresAt?`

## Listing And Prefixing

`list(...)` applies only to map stores.

- results are lexicographic by key
- pagination uses the standard live offset page request
  `{ offset?: number; limit: number }` and response
  `{ entries, count, offset, limit, nextOffset? }`
- this is live offset pagination, not snapshot or cursor pagination; concurrent
  writes or deletes can change what appears at later offsets
- public map-store listing has no unbounded mode; callers must choose a bounded
  page size
- `prefix(path)` composes path prefixes on the client and keeps the same typed
  map-store API

Implementation note: v1 backs map listing with NATS KV wildcard/prefix filtering
to select entries within a store namespace, then applies the requested bounded
page. Production storage implementations MUST preserve the public `limit` bound
and avoid exposing an unbounded key listing, even when the backing store has
different native pagination semantics.

Example:

```ts
const drafts = trellis.state.drafts.prefix("inspection/active");

await drafts.put("open", { title: "Draft" });
await drafts.get("open");
const page = await drafts.list({ limit: 10 });
for (const draft of page.entries) {
  console.log(draft.key, draft.value.title);
}
```

## Validation

- writes are validated against the declared store schema before the request is
  sent
- reads are validated against the declared store schema after the response is
  parsed
- migration-required responses validate the old value against the matching
  accepted-version schema before being returned to the runtime
- state values must be valid JSON on the wire
- malformed Trellis-owned stored envelopes or metadata are internal corruption
  and surface as `UnexpectedError`; caller-supplied values that fail the
  declared store schema remain normal validation failures

## TTL

NATS KV TTL is bucket-level, not per-entry. v1 therefore implements TTL as
application-managed expiry metadata:

- `put(..., { ttlMs })` may attach expiry metadata to one entry
- expired entries are treated as absent by `get`, `list`, `put` conditional
  checks, and `delete`
- handlers may opportunistically delete expired entries when encountered

## Admin Inspection

Admin inspection is separate from the normal runtime API.

- normal callers use only `trellis.state.<store>`
- admin callers use dedicated `State.Admin.*` RPCs
- admin APIs still target an explicit namespace and may distinguish
  `scope: "userApp" | "deviceApp"`
- user-app admin targets carry the exact stable Trellis `userId` directly; they
  do not use provider origin or identity fields
- admin APIs are for inspection and mutation by administrators, not for normal
  app/device runtime access

## Non-Goals

- a public normal-client `scope` parameter
- a public normal-client generic key/value namespace as the primary API
- cross-contract shared namespaces
- watch or realtime subscriptions
- service use of `State` instead of `resources.kv`
- binary/blob transport semantics
- patch or merge helpers in the contract surface
- strict total namespace quotas in v1
