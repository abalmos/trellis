# Design: Platform Libraries

## Prerequisites

- [trellis-patterns.md](./trellis-patterns.md) - Trellis architecture and
  platform boundaries
- [type-system-patterns.md](./type-system-patterns.md) - Result, schema, and
  error conventions
- [../auth/trellis-auth.md](./../auth/trellis-auth.md) - auth subsystem design

## Scope

This document defines the responsibilities of the core Trellis platform
libraries: which package owns which platform surface, which surfaces are public
or service-only, and which low-level details must stay behind runtime facades.

It is not a language-library usage guide. Ordinary app and service examples,
connection walkthroughs, and exact public signatures belong in:

- `/guides/libraries/typescript`
- `/guides/libraries/rust`
- `/api` for generated TypeScript API reference and Rustdoc links

## Core Libraries

## Library Rules

- `@qlever-llc/trellis` is the canonical app and service package for Trellis
  TypeScript development
- service APIs are defined with the service that owns them and are consumed
  through contract packages
- server helpers live on explicit Trellis subpaths
- first-party SDKs for Trellis-owned contracts live under explicit
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/sdk/*` subpaths
- contract modules that only need health heartbeat schemas should prefer root
  health re-exports or `@qlever-llc/trellis/health`
- framework adapters such as `@qlever-llc/trellis-svelte` remain separate
  packages
- platform packages should expose stable ergonomic surfaces and hide
  transport/bootstrap details
- browser-safe public runtime APIs and the kind-specific contract builders
  belong on `@qlever-llc/trellis`
- the root package should expose Trellis-owned lifecycle handles such as
  `TrellisConnection`, not raw transport handles such as `NatsConnection`
- browser-only login and portal-flow helpers belong on
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/auth` and the narrower `@qlever-llc/trellis/auth/browser`
  facade
- service-only resource handles and bootstrap helpers belong on
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/service*`
- `@qlever-llc/trellis/service` is a service-author surface and must not
  re-export low-level runtime/server internals
- generic SQL outbox helpers, including `service.createSqlOutbox(...)` and
  Trellis-owned helper-table migration artifacts, belong on
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/service*`; Drizzle-specific adapters stay isolated on
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/service/drizzle`
- public TypeScript jobs helpers belong on `@qlever-llc/trellis` and
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/service*`, not on a standalone jobs package

## `@qlever-llc/trellis`

Canonical TypeScript entrypoint for contract-driven RPC, operation, event, and
transfer-grant-driven file communication. The root package is browser-safe, does
not eagerly load generated SDKs, exports the normal kind-specific contract
builders plus health helpers, and keeps host-specific service helpers on
`@qlever-llc/trellis/service*` subpaths.

Rules:

- browser auth uses a session key stored in IndexedDB plus a bind flow;
  SvelteKit apps may layer on `@qlever-llc/trellis-svelte`
- app, agent, device, service, and CLI code should communicate through
  contract-derived RPC, operation, event, feed, state, and transfer facades
  rather than raw NATS subjects
- RPCs are timeout-bounded and expected remote failures use explicit `Result`
  conventions rather than exception-driven control flow
- operations and events are contract-driven rather than raw-subject-driven in
  normal app code
- admin jobs access should use `Jobs.*` RPCs declared through the jobs SDK
  rather than a client-side jobs helper
- transfer execution belongs to transfer-capable operations; receive grants are
  consumed through runtime transfer helpers rather than raw store bindings

Language-specific app and service walkthroughs belong in
`/guides/libraries/typescript`, `/guides/libraries/rust`, and `/api`.

### Server-Owned Runtime Helpers

`@qlever-llc/trellis/service` owns the service-only runtime surface.

Rules:

- service code should use `service.kv`, `service.store`, and `service.jobs`
  rather than a nested `service.resources.*` runtime shape
- schema-backed service KV resources are exposed directly as typed
  `service.kv.<alias>` and handler `client.kv.<alias>` stores; only store
  resources use `.open()`
- jobs-enabled services should declare top-level contract `jobs` and use
  `service.jobs.<queue>` plus `service.wait()` / `service.stop()` rather than
  raw worker-runtime helpers or stream bindings
- transfer-aware operation contexts belong on the server runtime surface for
  transfer-capable operations
- SQL outbox creation belongs on the service runtime surface: TypeScript
  services create it with `service.createSqlOutbox(...)`, and the returned
  object is a plain dependency that handlers close over at registration without
  importing low-level repository or dispatcher internals
- extracted service RPC handler aliases that need service-only helpers belong on
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/service*`, not the browser-safe root package, so handler
  types expose the canonical object argument shape and narrow injected `trellis`
  facade for `kv`, `store`, and transfer-aware operation contexts

## `@qlever-llc/trellis/sdk/*`

Provides the first-party generated SDKs for Trellis-owned contracts such as
auth, core, activity, jobs, health, and state.

Generated owner SDK package roots export direct action descriptors, portable
DTOs, and schemas. They do not export participant contracts, client/API facades,
or dependency selectors. Contract authors import only the descriptors they need
and place them directly in the participant contract's `uses` array.

- public apps and peer services should not resolve those service-owned handles
  directly

## `@qlever-llc/trellis-svelte`

Provides the app-level browser adapter for Svelte applications.

Rules:

- browser apps should centralize Trellis setup in one app-local module and
  expose app-scoped typed helpers to components
- the adapter derives the connected client type from the app contract and
  delegates runtime bootstrap/reconnect to the core browser client
- browser apps should not generate or import their own app SDK just to type the
  connected client; use `TrellisClientFor<typeof contract>` and generated
  service SDKs only for contract `uses` declarations
- `trellis-svelte` should keep the typed Trellis client and reactive connection
  adapter scoped to app-owned context rather than exposing a synthetic runtime
  bag
- `@qlever-llc/trellis-svelte` MUST NOT expose raw NATS clients, NATS connection
  state, or other transport-owned handles as public API
- normal pages and components should not recreate auth state; they should
  consume the live app-scoped Trellis context
- app-facing auth helpers should not require raw URL plumbing or placeholder
  positional arguments from app code; they should expose options-shaped APIs
  with sensible redirect defaults
- app-facing auth helpers should accept opaque portal context so apps and custom
  portals can coordinate runtime UX without hard-coding portal-specific
  parameters
- browser clients should route revoked or missing sessions (`session_not_found`)
  through the auth-required path so Svelte apps can redirect to their login
  route and preserve the current return URL
- dynamic auth-instance selection remains a valid advanced case, but the default
  public browser-app API should optimize for the fixed-instance path rather than
  forcing every app through explicit auth-state construction
- browser-app integrations should not require a `serviceName` prop; if a client
  label is needed for telemetry, it should derive from contract metadata or
  internal defaults
- exact Svelte helper names, provider props, and page/component examples belong
  in frontend/library guides and `/api`

## `@qlever-llc/trellis/auth`

Provides the full auth helper, schema, protocol, and browser bind surface. The
browser-only portal/login helper facade also lives at
`@qlever-llc/trellis/auth/browser`. See:

- [../auth/trellis-auth.md](./../auth/trellis-auth.md)
- [../auth/auth-api.md](./../auth/auth-api.md)
- `/api` in the guides site for exact TypeScript auth helpers and Rustdoc links

## `@qlever-llc/trellis/telemetry`

Provides the specialized Trellis telemetry facade used by runtime libraries and
services without widening the root package. It owns trace propagation helpers,
Trellis span helpers, telemetry initialization, and low-cardinality error metric
recording. See [observability-patterns.md](./observability-patterns.md).

Rules:

- runtime code should import telemetry helpers from
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/telemetry` or internal telemetry modules, not from a
  public `./tracing` subpath
- browser-safe entrypoints must not statically import OpenTelemetry SDK or
  exporter packages
- error metrics must use stable contract or runtime labels and must not include
  raw NATS subjects, user/session identifiers, trace IDs, request IDs, payloads,
  or error messages

## Jobs Surfaces

Service-private jobs are part of the Trellis runtime surface rather than a
standalone TypeScript package.

- TypeScript service-local jobs live on connected service runtimes as
  `service.jobs`
- TypeScript admin jobs access uses `Jobs.*` RPCs declared through
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/sdk/jobs`
- subsystem semantics and API details live in:
  - [../jobs/trellis-jobs.md](./../jobs/trellis-jobs.md)
  - `/api` in the guides site for exact TypeScript signatures and Rustdoc links

## `@qlever-llc/trellis/contracts`

Provides the advanced contract-model, manifest validation, canonicalization, SDK
generation, and documentation export surface behind the root package's curated
contract re-exports. See:

- normal contract source files may import the kind-specific helper they need
  from `@qlever-llc/trellis`
- advanced tooling, SDK generation, and low-level contract-model consumers
  should use `@qlever-llc/trellis/contracts`

- [../contracts/trellis-api-participants.md](./../contracts/trellis-api-participants.md)
- [../contracts/trellis-typescript-contract-authoring.md](./../contracts/trellis-typescript-contract-authoring.md)
- [../contracts/trellis-rust-contract-libraries.md](./../contracts/trellis-rust-contract-libraries.md)
