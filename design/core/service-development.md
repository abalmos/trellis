# Design: Service Development

## Prerequisites

- [trellis-patterns.md](./trellis-patterns.md) - Trellis architecture and
  communication model
- [type-system-patterns.md](./type-system-patterns.md) - schema and Result
  conventions
- [../operations/trellis-operations.md](./../operations/trellis-operations.md) -
  caller-visible async workflows
- [../jobs/trellis-jobs.md](./../jobs/trellis-jobs.md) - service-private jobs

## Design

This document describes Trellis participant bootstrap, lifecycle, and the
operations/jobs boundary. File layout, configuration parsing, databases,
dependency injection, and other application engineering choices are not Trellis
requirements. Examples below illustrate one possible service structure.

Before choosing a file layout, choose the participant kind and runtime helper.

### Participant kind and runtime helper

Repo folder names are local organization only. They do not determine Trellis
contract `kind`, install behavior, or which connect helper is correct.

| Contract kind  | Normal helper                 | Use when                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `service`      | `TrellisService.connect(...)` | The participant owns installable RPCs, operations, events, or service-owned resources and runs as a deployment service principal |
| `device`       | `TrellisDevice.connect(...)`  | The participant authenticates through device activation using a preregistered device root secret                                 |
| `app`, `agent` | `TrellisClient.connect(...)`  | The participant is a user-facing app, CLI, native app, or delegated tool rather than an installed service                        |

Rules:

- choose `kind` from the participant's identity and auth flow, not from the repo
  folder that contains the code
- code under `services/` may still correctly be `kind: "device"` when it is a
  repo-local demo, simulator, or utility that authenticates as a device
  principal
- a participant with no owned RPCs, operations, events, or resources is normal;
  do not invent owned APIs just to fit a service template
- only `kind: "service"` participants should use `TrellisService.connect(...)`,
  service deployment flows, and service-owned runtime handles such as
  `service.kv`, `service.store`, and `service.jobs`
- resolved service resource bindings are runtime internals; service authors use
  the handles returned by `TrellisService.connect(...)` rather than fetching,
  constructing, or passing binding payloads themselves
- operation and service-private job traffic inherits the connected principal's
  context-derived transport permissions; operation declarations and job subject
  names never create grants or widen those permissions

### Directory structure

```text
services/<name>/
├── contract.trellis # Native API and participant declarations
├── main.ts          # Bootstrap, handlers, shutdown
├── config.ts        # Environment configuration
├── globals.ts       # Shared runtime state
├── deno.json        # Tasks, imports
└── <domain>.ts      # Business logic
```

The layout above is optional. Smaller repo-local participants such as demos or
utilities may only need `main.ts`, `deno.json`, and `contract.trellis`. Projects
with multiple source files use direct children of `contracts/*.trellis` instead.

### Lifecycle

For `kind: "service"` participants:

```ts
import { TrellisService } from "@qlever-llc/trellis/service/deno";
import { participant } from "./.trellis/ts/participants/acme-service/mod.ts";

const service = await TrellisService.connect({
  trellisUrl: config.trellisUrl,
  participant,
  name: "<name>",
  identity: config.identity,
  authorizationContextStore,
}).orThrow();

// Names come from this example's declared RPC and event.
await service.handleSomeMethod(handler);
await service.onSomeEvent(eventHandler).orThrow();

const shutdown = async () => {
  try {
    await service.stop();
  } finally {
    Deno.removeSignalListener("SIGTERM", shutdown);
  }
};

Deno.addSignalListener("SIGTERM", shutdown);
await service.wait();
```

Rules:

- service code MUST bootstrap through `TrellisService.connect(...)`; do not
  import the core SDK to recreate service bootstrap or call
  `Trellis.Bindings.Get` from application code
- service code MUST NOT construct `TrellisService`, `StoreHandle`, or resource
  handles directly, and MUST NOT pass resolved binding or resource data into
  `Trellis` constructors
- `service.wait()` supervises the Trellis lifecycle; `service.stop()` releases
  its resources. The application decides how OS signals and its other resources
  participate in shutdown. The Deno signal listener above is one example.

### Application dependencies

Trellis does not inject application dependencies into handlers. Handler
arguments contain only Trellis-owned runtime data. Application resources such as
databases, loggers, repositories, schedulers, search indexes, and SQL outbox
instances can be supplied by JavaScript closures or factories, including those
constructed by the application's own DI system. Trellis runtime context remains
separate from application dependencies — do not merge app dependencies into
`context`, and do not pass dependency bags as handler registration options.

Example:

```ts
type EntityListHandler = RpcHandler<typeof participant, "Entity.List">;

type ServiceDeps = {
  db: Db;
  logger: Logger;
};

export function createEntityListHandler(deps: ServiceDeps): EntityListHandler {
  return async ({ input, context, client }) => {
    deps.logger.info({ caller: context.caller }, "listing entities");
    return Result.ok(await listEntities(deps.db, input));
  };
}

await service.handleEntityList(createEntityListHandler(deps));
```

### Service-local storage

Application storage is application-owned. Trellis does not open a service's
database, select its identifier scheme, or require a repository pattern. The
Trellis control-plane uses SQLite for its own durable runtime records; that
implementation is not a constraint on consumers.

Rules:

- service-local storage is an implementation detail unless the contract exposes
  a public API over it
- each Trellis runtime subsystem owns a separate SQLite file configured through
  its `[platform|jobs|health|eventlog.storage]` section; runtime configuration
  rejects sharing one SQLite path across subsystem boundaries
- direct event publish remains the default; use SQL outbox only when event
  publication must be coupled to service-local SQL state
- TypeScript services create a SQL outbox helper with
  `service.createSqlOutbox(...)` using generic SQL executor and
  transaction-runner options; the returned object is a plain dependency that
  handlers close over at registration
- handlers receive Trellis-owned args only; SQL outbox access comes from the
  closed-over dependency
- `outbox.transaction(...)` is the boundary for application SQL writes and all
  event enqueues that must commit atomically; service code owns the database
  lifecycle and transaction boundaries
- transaction-scoped `event.*.*.enqueue(...)` prepares and validates events,
  then writes prepared event rows into Trellis helper tables through the
  transaction-scoped executor
- Trellis owns the SQL outbox/inbox helper-table schema and versioned migration
  artifacts exposed by `getSqlOutboxMigrations(...)`; services own table names
  and run the migrations with their normal migration tooling
- after a successful transaction commit, Trellis notifies the dispatcher only
  when at least one row was enqueued; no dispatcher notification happens for a
  rolled-back or rejected transaction
- outbox dispatcher wakeups should be debounced and single-flight, but they are
  latency optimizations only; durable retry and recovery depend on persisted
  outbox state plus explicit dispatch or recovery scans
- NATS KV outbox/inbox helpers remain non-SQL durable helpers for dedupe and
  queue storage, but they are not transactional with unrelated database side
  effects

Example:

```ts
const outbox = service.createSqlOutbox({
  dialect: "postgres",
  executor,
  transaction: (work) =>
    pool.transaction((tx) =>
      work({
        tx,
        executor: createExecutorForTransaction(tx),
      })
    ),
  tables: {
    outbox: "trellis_outbox",
    inbox: "trellis_inbox",
  },
});

const deps = { outbox, partnerRepo, auditRepo };

function createPartnerUpdateHandler(deps: ServiceDeps): PartnerUpdateHandler {
  return async ({ input }) => {
    const updated = await deps.outbox.transaction(async ({ tx, event }) => {
      await deps.partnerRepo.update(tx, input.partner);
      await deps.auditRepo.insert(tx, { entityId: input.partner.id });

      await event.partner.changed.enqueue({ id: input.partner.id }).orThrow();
      await event.audit.recorded.enqueue({ entityId: input.partner.id })
        .orThrow();

      return true;
    }).orThrow();

    return Result.ok({ updated });
  };
}

await service.handlePartnerUpdate(createPartnerUpdateHandler(deps));
```

**With job creation:**

```ts
const handler = async ({ input, deps }) => {
  const updated = await deps.outbox.transaction(async ({ tx, event, job }) => {
    await deps.partnerRepo.update(tx, input.partner);

    const submission = await job.partnerSync.create({
      partnerId: input.partner.id,
    }).orThrow();

    await event.partner.changed.enqueue({ id: input.partner.id }).orThrow();

    return { updated: true, submissionId: submission.submissionId };
  }).orThrow();

  return Result.ok(updated);
};
```

### Minimal installable service example

```trellis
api "acme.echo@v1" {
  version "1.0.0";
  display_name "Echo Service";
  description "A minimal installable Trellis service example.";
  model EchoMessage { message: string; }
  error UnexpectedError;
  rpc "Echo.Ping" {
    version "v1";
    input EchoMessage;
    output EchoMessage;
    errors [UnexpectedError];
  }
}

participant "acme.echo@v1" service {
  implements "acme.echo@v1";
}
```

```ts
import { Result } from "@qlever-llc/trellis";
import { TrellisService } from "@qlever-llc/trellis/service/deno";
import { participant } from "./.trellis/ts/participants/acme-echo-v1/mod.ts";

const service = await TrellisService.connect({
  trellisUrl,
  participant,
  name: "echo",
  identity, // Provisioned identity and accepted participant binding.
  authorizationContextStore, // Durable store owned by this installation.
}).orThrow();

await service.handleEchoPing(({ input }) =>
  Result.ok({ message: input.message })
);

service.health.setInfo({ version: "1.0.0" });
service.health.add("readiness", () => ({ status: "ok" }));
await service.wait(); // Call service.stop() from the application's shutdown path.
```

Rules:

- this example owns an RPC so a reader can call it; a service's actual mix of
  public surfaces and outbound dependencies is application-owned
- installable service code uses `TrellisService.connect(...)` and mounts only
  names from its generated participant surface
- service resource handles come from the connected runtime; do not call
  `Trellis.Bindings.Get` or manually construct service, KV, store, or jobs
  handles in service-author code
- the optional `server` block configures service-runtime concerns such as
  logging, default request timeout, event-consumer stream selection,
  no-responder retry behavior, and health heartbeat interval
- `TrellisService.connect(...)` does not run service-owned database migrations,
  including Trellis SQL outbox helper-table migrations; services run those with
  their normal migration tooling before handlers depend on the tables
- `server.log` defaults to the package server logger; set it to `false` to
  disable runtime logging or provide a pino-compatible logger to use your own
- service runtime NATS lifecycle logging is explicit rather than generic;
  disconnect, reconnect attempts, reconnect success, stale connections, and
  connection errors should each log a distinct message so operators can tell
  whether the service is recovering or stuck
- `TrellisService.connect(...)` publishes baseline samples automatically through
  the private health transport, using its bootstrap-authorized deployment and
  instance identity; service code may enrich them through
  `service.health.setInfo(...)` and `service.health.add(...)`
- health heartbeats refresh freshness and operator-visible status only for the
  already accepted matching implementation offer; they must not create offers or
  change the offered digest
- graceful `service.stop()` marks the accepted offer stale for the same short
  grace window used after unplanned disconnects
- Trellis provides payload typing and wire validation; applications remain
  responsible for business rules beyond those schemas
- inline TypeScript handlers can infer from `service.handle...` registration;
  extracted handlers can use `RpcHandler<typeof participant, "Echo.Ping">` from
  `@qlever-llc/trellis/service`
- mounted RPC handlers may be synchronous when they do not need `await`
- mounted RPC handlers may return declared local `TrellisError` subclasses
  directly when those errors are listed in the contract RPC `errors: [...]`
- declare service-local transportable RPC errors with native IDL `error`
  declarations and include them in the RPC's `errors` list
- declare remote action selections in native IDL `use required` or
  `use optional` blocks; regenerate rather than constructing SDK `use(...)`
  results in application code
- if the service needs durable event processing, declare an explicit event
  consumer group in IDL with its `subscribe event` selections. A bare dependency
  `subscribe event` grant authorizes live/ephemeral listening only; it does not
  create a durable cursor, but dependency durable consumption remains
  authority-backed by the top-level `uses` declaration.

Behavior:

- `TrellisService.connect(...)` performs bootstrap, auth handshake, participant
  verification, runtime connection setup, and eager binding resolution
- if Trellis does not know the requested digest, service bootstrap presents the
  canonical participant artifact carried by the generated participant module
- service bootstrap validates and analyzes the presented manifest as a contract
  proposal; invalid manifests fail immediately, while unknown required `uses`
  dependencies produce targeted dependency blockers unless deployment authority
  supplies an accepted dependency shape. Bootstrap does not derive authority
  from historical manifests.
- optional `uses` dependencies that are missing or whose requested surfaces are
  missing do not fail bootstrap planning and do not grant runtime authority;
  when they later resolve as active, they require an authority update or
  authority migration before a fresh reconnect receives that authority
- Trellis derives requested needs from the contract proposal and compares them
  to deployment authority desired state
- if desired authority is missing, bootstrap classifies the delta. Safe updates
  auto-apply. Updates that add new capability grants or resource aliases record
  a pending authority update and ask the service runtime to wait and retry until
  an admin accepts or rejects the proposal.
- service-originated pending authority proposals are durable and deduplicated by
  the requested boundary so repeated starts with the same missing boundary
  coalesce into one pending authority update or migration
- if the service presents a different digest for the same `contractId` as the
  deployment's latest accepted digest or offer, Trellis validates same-lineage
  compatibility. Incompatible replacement is an authority migration. In `strict`
  mode, bootstrap records a pending migration plan and asks the service runtime
  to wait and retry until an admin accepts or rejects it. In `mutable-dev` mode,
  Trellis records and auto-accepts the same migration plan for unreleased
  iteration, then continues through normal desired-state and materialization
  checks.
- compatibility mode controls whether migrations require manual approval or are
  auto-approved for development; it does not make contract history an authority
  source
- once deployment authority desired state covers the requested needs, bootstrap
  verifies that required `uses` dependencies resolve against effective active
  contracts or accepted dependency shapes. If a required dependency has neither,
  bootstrap returns a dependency-not-active blocker and the runtime waits and
  retries.
- if desired authority exists but materialization is incomplete, bootstrap
  returns reconciliation pending and the runtime waits and retries; bootstrap
  never provisions resources
- if a service presents a contract that no longer fits enabled deployment
  authority, bootstrap returns `contract_changed` rather than refreshing an old
  offer or issuing credentials for stale authority
- after the dependency closure is active or accepted and all required
  materialized resource bindings are present, bootstrap accepts or refreshes the
  implementation offer, persists instance runtime state, and returns transport
  and binding details to the service runtime
- all declared `resources.kv`, `resources.store`, top-level `jobs`, and
  top-level `eventConsumers` bindings are materialized authority resources. A
  service must not become ready with a silently skipped declared resource;
  `required: false` only makes the generated service handle optional.
- schema-backed KV handles such as `service.kv.<alias>` resolve during bootstrap
  as direct typed stores, while store handles such as `service.store.<alias>`
  are opened explicitly before use
- transfer-capable operations receive runtime-owned transfer contexts while
  service code continues to access staged files through `service.store.*`
- when a contract declares top-level `jobs`, `TrellisService.connect(...)`
  resolves a typed `service.jobs` facade for job creation, handler registration,
  and worker startup
- when a contract declares `eventConsumers`, `TrellisService.connect(...)`
  receives the reconciled event-consumer bindings during bootstrap. Register
  listeners during startup through `service.onOrdersChanged(..., { group })`
  (name follows the declared event); handler-injected clients are outbound-only
  and cannot register long-lived listeners. Service code must not choose or
  create a JetStream `durableName` for contract event processing; runtime
  durable consumers are Trellis-provisioned only.
- grouped durable event consumers start only after every event in the group has
  a registered handler, preserving the contract-declared group as the unit of
  ordering and replay.
- the shared jobs streams are Trellis-owned infrastructure; reconciliation
  creates or adopts all declared job bindings before jobs-enabled services
  become ready. Bootstrap resolves those materialized bindings. Jobs admin
  projections are internal to the Jobs admin runtime.
- the latest presented contract is not the ongoing source of truth for already
  accepted resources; deployment authority owns desired state until an authority
  update or authority migration changes it
- when an RPC needs to start caller-visible follow-up work after a transfer,
  prefer a transfer-capable operation over an RPC-started workflow
- the `trellis` control-plane service is the one bootstrap exception and may use
  Trellis-internal bootstrap paths; that exception is not part of the public
  service-author surface

### Jobs and operations

Use operations for caller-visible asynchronous workflows and jobs for
service-private execution.

Behavior:

- if a user or peer service needs to observe async work, expose an operation
  from the owning service contract
- if work is only an internal execution detail, use a job and keep it behind the
  service boundary
- operation APIs should expose `OperationRef`-style handles with `get()`,
  `wait()`, and optional `watch()`
- service-local jobs APIs should expose per-job-type handles with `create()`
  returning `JobRef`, synchronous handler registration through
  `service.jobs.<queue>.handle(...)`, and service-owned worker lifecycle through
  `service.wait()` / `service.stop()`
- public APIs must not expose weak raw wire types except in explicit
  raw/debug/admin surfaces
- public service APIs should hang off connected runtime objects such as
  `service.jobs`, `service.operation.<group>.<leaf>`, and
  `service.handle.operation.<group>.<leaf>`

### Files and transfer

Services should treat `Files` as the public interface to service-owned `store`
resources.

Behavior:

- metadata and control actions such as list/head/delete remain ordinary
  contract-owned RPCs
- byte transfer belongs on transfer-capable operations rather than separate
  initiation RPCs
- raw byte movement is executed through Trellis runtime helpers rather than
  hand-written service-specific chunk protocols
- service code uses `service.store.<alias>` plus operation transfer contexts to
  back those public file APIs

Example:

```ts
const op = await billing.operation.billing.refund.start(input);
const done = await op.wait();

const job = await service.jobs.refundCharge.create({
  operationId: op.id,
  ...payload,
});
return op.defer();
```

The job handler resumes the caller-visible operation through the
operation-scoped service control helper. It must not reach into private runtime
fields.

```ts
service.jobs.refundCharge.handle(async ({ job }) => {
  const op = await service.handle.operation.billing.refund
    .control(job.payload.operationId)
    .orThrow();

  await op.progress({ step: "capturing", message: "Capturing refund" })
    .orThrow();
  await op.complete({ refundId: "rf_123" }).orThrow();

  return Result.ok({ completed: true });
});
```
