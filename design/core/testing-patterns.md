# Design: Testing Patterns

## Prerequisites

- [trellis-patterns.md](./trellis-patterns.md) - Trellis architecture and
  runtime boundaries
- [../contracts/trellis-contracts-catalog.md](./../contracts/trellis-contracts-catalog.md) -
  contract-owned surfaces and permission derivation

## Design

Trellis behavior is distributed runtime behavior. Tests that prove Trellis
runtime behavior must use a live Trellis control plane and real TypeScript and
Rust client/service paths.

### Live-First Rule

Use live integration tests for Trellis behavior. This includes behavior observed
through HTTP routes, generated RPCs, operations, jobs, feeds, events, transfer,
state, resources, auth, bootstrap, device activation, service deployment,
catalog, permissions, NATS subjects, storage-backed runtime state, retry,
rollback, restart, and failure handling.

Do not prove Trellis behavior with fake NATS, fake Hono, fake storage, fake
runtime, fake auth, fake generated clients, or fake control-plane responders.
Those tests create a second implementation of Trellis and drift from the
runtime.

When a behavior is not reachable through current public test helpers, extend the
test library with the smallest named live-test surface needed to produce or
observe the behavior. Prefer case-scoped helpers in `trellis-test` over generic
chaos frameworks. Examples include a one-shot failure hook, a control-plane
SQLite inspection helper, or a JetStream inspection helper.

### Matrix Parity

Runtime behavior that exists in both TypeScript and Rust must have matching live
coverage in both languages before related unit coverage is deleted or considered
retired.

Rules:

- add or update `integration/test-matrix.json` for language-neutral behavior
- register the TypeScript case in the relevant JS integration support registry
- register the Rust case in the Rust integration support registry
- mark a row complete only when both TypeScript and Rust live tests pass
- do not use TypeScript-only service-integration coverage as retirement evidence
  for Trellis behavior that Rust can observe too

### Unit Test Boundary

Unit tests are the exception. Keep them only when the behavior is not Trellis
runtime behavior:

- pure parser, codec, canonicalization, crypto vector, schema pointer, or error
  serialization checks
- package export/import, publishing, generated artifact, or type-surface smoke
  checks
- CLI argument parsing and release-tool planning checks
- tiny UI copy or page-state helpers

If a unit test needs fake Trellis runtime pieces to pass, it probably belongs in
live integration. Delete it after live TS/Rust coverage proves the same
behavior, or replace it with a smaller pure-function test if a real pure
invariant remains.

Retained unit tests should document why they are not live integration tests. The
comment should name the pure invariant, not say that the behavior is merely
"private" or "not public". Current Trellis behavior is the behavior to protect;
the question is whether it is runtime-observable and therefore belongs in live
integration.

### Verification Practice

Verification has three explicit tiers:

- **Tier 1, inner loop:** format changed files and run the smallest affected
  package tests, type checks, and live fixture or case that prove the change.
- **Tier 2, phase gate:** run preparation when generated artifacts may change,
  workspace formatting, lint and documentation checks, affected package suites,
  and the matching TypeScript and Rust live cases plus matrix conformance.
- **Tier 3, release gate:** run `cargo xtask release verify` and the release
  workflow's full unfiltered TypeScript and Rust integration suites, packaging,
  MSRV, and platform checks.

Tier 1 and Tier 2 results are scoped evidence, not a full verification claim. Do
not rerun Tier 3 after every implementation track; run it once from the final
integrated source state before release.
