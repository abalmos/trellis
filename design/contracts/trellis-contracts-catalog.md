# Design: Trellis Contracts And Catalog

## Prerequisites

- [../core/trellis-patterns.md](./../core/trellis-patterns.md) - service
  patterns and platform boundaries
- [../auth/trellis-auth.md](./../auth/trellis-auth.md) - session keys, auth
  callout, and dynamic authorization

## Context

Trellis needs one contract model that works for five different concerns at the
same time:

- service authors need a local way to define operations, RPCs, events, jobs,
  schemas, authorization requirements, and cloud resource requests
- the `trellis` runtime must derive runtime NATS permissions from the APIs that
  are actually active in a deployment
- clients and peer services need typed SDKs
- documentation and tooling need a language-neutral artifact
- operators need a reviewable contract proposal describing requested service
  needs before those needs become deployment authority

Those needs apply across multiple repos and multiple implementation languages.

This document is the architecture and specification for the canonical manifest,
catalog projections, digest projection, dependency model, and permission
derivation. It is not the place for ordinary language-library usage. TypeScript
and Rust authoring walkthroughs belong in `/guides/libraries/typescript`,
`/guides/libraries/rust`, and exact generated APIs/Rustdoc are linked from
`/api`.

## Goals

- Keep API ownership with the service that implements the API.
- Define one canonical contract artifact for runtime and tooling.
- Make the active deployment contract set discoverable at runtime.
- Make cloud-provided service resources explicit and reviewable before they
  become deployment authority desired state.
- Support generated SDKs and docs from the same source of truth.
- Support operations, RPC, domain events, jobs, and contract-owned state.
- Support declarative resource requests with cloud-assigned physical bindings.
- Support Trellis-owned contracts and cloud/domain service contracts with the
  same mechanism.

## Non-Goals

- Defining one required human authoring language for every service.
- Making AsyncAPI the canonical runtime model.
- Documenting historical implementation paths.

## Design

### 1) Canonical artifacts

Trellis defines two canonical JSON artifacts:

- `trellis.contract.v1` - one service contract manifest
- `trellis.catalog.v1` - the runtime's active implementation projection

Both artifacts are pure JSON values. They are language-neutral and safe to
persist, hash, validate, transmit, and use for code generation.

### 2) Contract lineage and implementation model

Every contract belongs to one stable contract lineage identified by `id`.
Presented contracts are contract proposals: they declare requested needs and
provided surfaces. Accepted requested needs become deployment authority desired
state; provided surfaces remain subject to compatibility validation.

- Trellis-managed contracts such as `trellis.core@v1`, `trellis.auth@v1`, and
  `trellis.state@v1` are implemented by the `trellis` runtime service even when
  they are committed in the Trellis repo
- cloud/domain contracts live in the repo that implements the corresponding
  service behavior
- a single service principal may implement multiple logical contracts
- Trellis runtime libraries do not act as a handwritten central registry for all
  service APIs

### 3) Authoring model

The canonical source of truth for runtime and tooling is the authored contract
definition.

For repository layout and tooling boundaries, Trellis treats generated
`trellis.contract.v1` JSON as a release and exchange artifact, not as a
committed source file.

- services may author contracts in their native language
- those authoring helpers are normal workflow inputs, not hidden implementation
  details
- `trellis` verifies, packs, and uses generated manifests produced from those
  contract sources

The human-authored source may vary by language or team as long as it
deterministically emits a valid manifest.

Examples:

- a TypeScript service may author a contract with `@qlever-llc/trellis`
- a Rust service may author a contract with Rust-side types/macros/build tooling
- a Python service may author a contract with Python-native tooling
- a service may author the manifest directly if desired, but that is not the
  default workflow

The architectural requirement is not a specific authoring language. The
requirement is deterministic production of the canonical manifest.

### 4) JSON Schema dialect

All embedded schemas in a contract manifest MUST be JSON Schema compatible
values using the same dialect Trellis validates at runtime.

For v1:

- dialect: JSON Schema Draft 2019-09
- schema fields MAY be either a JSON object schema or a boolean schema
- manifests MUST be self-contained; v1 embedded schemas MUST NOT use `$ref`,
  including local or remote targets. Cross-schema references belong in Trellis
  schema-ref fields such as `{ "schema": "Name" }`.

## Specification

### 5) Contract manifest: top-level shape

A `trellis.contract.v1` manifest has this top-level structure:

```json
{
  "format": "trellis.contract.v1",
  "id": "graph@v1",
  "displayName": "Graph Service",
  "description": "Serve graph RPCs and publish graph change events.",
  "docs": {
    "summary": "Graph service contract.",
    "markdown": "# Graph Service\n\nTyped graph APIs and change events."
  },
  "kind": "service",
  "capabilities": {
    "graph::users.read": {
      "displayName": "Read users",
      "description": "View user records exposed by the graph service."
    }
  },
  "schemas": {
    "Checkpoint": { "type": "object" }
  },
  "exports": {
    "schemas": ["Checkpoint"]
  },
  "uses": {},
  "jobs": {},
  "operations": {},
  "rpc": {},
  "events": {},
  "feeds": {},
  "eventConsumers": {},
  "state": {},
  "resources": {
    "kv": {
      "state": {
        "purpose": "Store service checkpoints",
        "schema": { "schema": "Checkpoint" },
        "required": true,
        "history": 1,
        "ttlMs": 0
      }
    }
  },
  "errors": {}
}
```

Top-level fields:

| Field            | Required | Type   | Meaning                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `format`         | yes      | string | MUST equal `trellis.contract.v1`                                   |
| `id`             | yes      | string | Stable contract identifier such as `trellis.core@v1` or `graph@v1` |
| `displayName`    | yes      | string | Human-facing contract name shown in tooling and review UIs         |
| `description`    | yes      | string | Human-facing explanation of the contract's purpose                 |
| `docs`           | no       | object | Optional authored documentation metadata                           |
| `kind`           | yes      | string | Contract role such as `service`, `app`, `agent`, or `device`       |
| `capabilities`   | no       | object | Human-facing metadata for contract-owned capability keys           |
| `schemas`        | no       | object | Reusable self-contained JSON Schema values keyed by schema name    |
| `exports`        | no       | object | Canonical public exports made available to dependent contracts     |
| `uses`           | no       | object | Explicit cross-contract operation/RPC/event dependencies           |
| `jobs`           | no       | object | Map of first-class service-private job queue descriptors           |
| `operations`     | no       | object | Map of logical operation names to operation descriptors            |
| `rpc`            | no       | object | Map of logical RPC names to RPC operation descriptors              |
| `events`         | no       | object | Map of logical event names to event descriptors                    |
| `feeds`          | no       | object | Map of logical feed names to feed descriptors                      |
| `eventConsumers` | no       | object | Map of durable event consumer group descriptors                    |
| `state`          | no       | object | Map of named Trellis-managed state stores                          |
| `resources`      | no       | object | Map of declarative cloud resource requests                         |
| `errors`         | no       | object | Map of declared error types to error descriptors                   |

Rules:

- `format`, `id`, `displayName`, `description`, and `kind` are required.
- `schemas` is the contract-level schema registry referenced by RPC, operations,
  events, jobs, state declarations, and schema-backed KV resources.
- `exports.schemas` is the canonical list of schema names exported from the
  contract-level `schemas` registry for other contracts and generated APIs to
  reference.
- every name in `exports.schemas` MUST resolve to a top-level `schemas` entry;
  exported schemas follow the same self-contained schema rules as all other
  contract schema refs.
- `kind` drives discovery behavior in bootstrap-safe generation flows: `service`
  contracts generate manifests and SDKs, while `app`, `agent`, and `device`
  contracts are verified. User-facing runtime identity is still authority-bound:
  browser apps anchor by origin, CLI/native tools by session public key, and
  device-user flows by device public key rather than by contract digest alone.
- `displayName` and `description` are human-facing manifest metadata for
  catalog, docs, and review UI. They are not part of contract digest identity.
- `docs` is optional authored documentation metadata. It is normalized supported
  metadata and is not part of contract digest identity.
- `capabilities` is human-facing review metadata, but it is runtime authority
  metadata rather than display-only contract metadata. It participates in the
  contract digest because changing a capability's meaning changes what users and
  operators approve.
- runtime service identity, install routing, and authorization boundaries MUST
  NOT be inferred from manifest metadata.
- top-level object members not defined by the current runtime MAY be present for
  forward compatibility; runtimes MUST ignore unknown top-level fields they do
  not understand.

### 5.1) Contract docs metadata

Contracts MAY include authored documentation metadata on the contract and on
owned contract surfaces.

Shape:

```ts
docs?: {
  summary?: string;
  markdown: string;
}
```

Rules:

- `docs.markdown` is required when `docs` is present; `docs.summary` is
  optional.
- `docs` MAY appear at the contract level and on owned RPCs, operations,
  operation signals, events, feeds, jobs, event consumer groups, state stores,
  KV resources, and store resources.
- `docs` is normalized supported metadata. It is preserved in normalized
  manifests for generated documentation and tooling.
- `docs` is excluded from the contract digest projection. Documentation-only
  edits can update generated docs and catalog metadata without changing runtime
  identity, authority, resources, dependencies, or wire shape.
- `docs` is separate from `displayName` and `description`, which provide concise
  catalog, docs, and review UI copy.
- `docs` is separate from capability metadata. Capability `displayName`,
  `description`, and `consequence` define the human meaning of granted authority
  and participate in the digest projection.

### 6) Contract identity

The contract `id` identifies one logical contract lineage.

Examples:

- `trellis.core@v1`
- `trellis.jobs@v1`
- `trellis.portal.activation@v1`
- `graph@v1`

Rules:

- `id` MUST be stable for semantically compatible revisions within the same
  major line
- a breaking contract revision MUST use a new `@vN` suffix
- Trellis-owned contracts, including Trellis-owned app contracts, SHOULD use the
  `trellis.` prefix so ownership is visible from the stable lineage id
- within one Trellis runtime, each `id` is globally unique for subject ownership
  and generated SDK identity
- a new digest for the same `id` is reviewed as a contract proposal against
  deployment authority; the digest is not itself durable authority
- service deployments default to `strict` same-contract compatibility, which
  treats incompatible replacement for the same contract id as a pending
  authority migration requiring explicit admin acceptance. Development
  deployments may opt into `mutable-dev`, which auto-accepts that same migration
  plan for fast local iteration while still recording it in authority
  plan/history.

### 6.1) Contract digest projection

The contract digest is computed from the canonical semantic projection of the
manifest, not from every byte in the submitted JSON document.

The digest projection includes:

- `format`, `id`, and `kind`
- top-level `capabilities`
- reachable schemas referenced by state, RPCs, operations, operation errors,
  operation signals, events, feeds, jobs, schema-backed KV resources, and
  declared RPC error schemas
- state, `uses`, RPCs, operations (including operation errors), events, feeds,
  jobs, `eventConsumers`, declared RPC errors, and KV/store resource requests
- sorted and deduplicated capability and `uses` selector lists

The digest projection excludes:

- contract-level `displayName`, `description`, and other display-only review
  metadata
- `docs` metadata at the contract level and on owned contract surfaces
- `exports` and other code-generation metadata that does not change runtime
  permissions or wire surfaces
- unused schemas and undeclared error definitions
- unknown top-level extension fields that the current runtime ignores

Rules:

- tooling and runtime implementations MUST use the same digest projection before
  comparing reviewed and accepted manifests
- digest projection and manifest normalization are Trellis protocol rules, not
  language-helper rules; every supported implementation MUST either call the
  shared contract utilities for its language or pass shared conformance vectors
  that prove the same projection
- runtimes MUST NOT compute a digest from a service-local normalized copy of a
  manifest unless that normalization is the shared contract manifest
  normalization for the current Trellis protocol version
- authority update and authority migration proposals that include a presented
  contract MUST carry the locally reviewed digest, and auth MUST reject the
  proposal if canonical digest computation produces a different digest
- digest-stable metadata edits may update catalog display information without
  requiring new runtime permissions or new app consent prompts, but capability
  metadata edits are not digest-stable
- the runtime catalog projection MUST NOT publish multiple active digests for
  one Trellis-owned `id`
- service authority comes from deployment authority desired state, reconciled
  materialized authority, accepted implementation offers, and enabled service
  deployment/instance records; installable service packages are not the runtime
  authority source

Manifest normalization is separate from digest projection:

- manifest normalization produces the canonical supported manifest shape used
  for validation, persistence, code generation, and runtime install; it
  preserves human-facing fields such as `displayName`, `description`, and `docs`
- the global `contracts` store is a content-addressed manifest cache keyed by
  digest. Deployment authority, materialized authority, identity grants, and
  implementation offers are the durable authority records; cached manifests are
  rebuildable from later full-manifest presentation.
- digest projection starts from the normalized manifest and keeps only fields
  that define runtime identity, authority, resources, dependencies, or wire
  shape
- unknown top-level extension fields MAY appear in submitted manifests for
  forward compatibility, but current runtimes MUST drop them during manifest
  normalization and MUST NOT let them affect the digest until the Trellis
  protocol explicitly defines their semantics
- adding a supported top-level manifest field requires updating the shared
  manifest normalization and digest projection/conformance vectors in the same
  change whenever the field has runtime or authority semantics

This allows Trellis to validate a proposed replacement before a service or
device offer for the same `id` becomes accepted. Preregistered device firmware
revisions that map to different digests in one device lineage still resolve
through deployment authority rather than a deployment digest allow list.

### 6.2) Runtime implementation offers

Contract proposals, deployment authority, and implementation liveness are
separate concepts.

Terms:

- **known contract**: a validated normalized manifest stored by digest in the
  global `contracts` cache, or a built-in Trellis manifest. Known contracts are
  rebuildable content-addressed facts. They are not runtime authority and do not
  become active merely because they are stored. If a cached manifest no longer
  validates under the current runtime, Trellis may delete that cache entry and
  require a future request to present the full manifest again.
- **presented contract**: the manifest or digest supplied by a participant
  during bootstrap, reconnect, authority planning, or review. A presented
  contract is scoped to that request.
- **contract proposal**: requested needs plus provided surfaces derived from a
  presented contract. Accepted requested needs become deployment authority
  desired state; provided surfaces remain protected by compatibility validation.
- **deployment authority**: deployment-owned desired state for accepted access,
  capabilities, resource definitions, and runtime authority. It is not
  continuously re-derived from the latest contract after acceptance.
- **materialized authority**: reconciled actual resources, bindings, and grants
  that are safe to expose to runtimes.
- **implementation offer**: an accepted statement that a service or device
  instance currently implements one `contractId` at one digest for one
  deployment. Offers are derived from successful runtime bootstrap or
  activation, not from every known manifest and not from deployment authority.
- **active offer**: an implementation offer whose deployment and instance are
  enabled, whose current connection is live or still within the configured grace
  window, and whose `expiresAt` has not passed.
- **effective active contract**: for one `contractId`, the compatible union of
  all active offers for that lineage. Multiple service versions may run together
  during rollout only when their owned surfaces are active-compatible.
- **accepted dependency shape**: when no active offer exists for a dependency
  `contractId`, deployment authority may retain the accepted dependency shape
  for service bootstrap planning and requested-need validation. This is durable
  desired state, not runtime liveness, and it does not publish the contract into
  the active catalog.
- **stale offer**: an offer whose connection has disconnected or whose graceful
  shutdown has been observed, but whose short grace window has not expired.
- **expired offer**: an offer past `expiresAt`. Expired offers do not contribute
  to active implementation projection, dependency resolution, reconciliation, or
  runtime authorization.

Rules:

- non-builtin runtime activity is derived from active offers only
- known historical manifests MUST NOT be broadly merged into authority planning,
  reconciliation, dependency resolution, catalog, or runtime authorization
  decisions
- invalid cached manifests MUST be treated as cache corruption, not authority
  state. Trellis MAY prune invalid cached manifests without mutating
  implementation offers, deployment authority, identity grants, materialized
  authority, sessions, or resource bindings.
- if an active offer references a digest whose non-builtin manifest is missing
  from the cache, Trellis excludes that digest from the effective active catalog
  until the manifest is presented again; the offer itself remains the runtime
  liveness/evidence record.
- deployment authority MAY include desired surfaces that no active
  implementation currently offers; that is allowed because deployment authority
  is desired state, not liveness
- if no active offer exists for a required dependency, Trellis may use the
  accepted dependency shape from deployment authority; if no accepted shape
  exists, Trellis reports a targeted dependency-not-active blocker rather than
  searching historical manifests for a compatible shape
- if active offers for one `contractId` are compatible, Trellis derives the
  effective active contract from their union
- if a newly presented offer is incompatible with the latest accepted
  same-lineage digest or offer, bootstrap classifies the replacement as an
  authority migration before the offer becomes active. `strict` records the plan
  as pending; `mutable-dev` records and auto-accepts the same plan.
- if incompatible active offers already exist because of a race or migration,
  Trellis keeps the previous effective active set and surfaces a catalog
  compatibility issue for operators
- the latest accepted expired offer for a deployment and `contractId` MAY be
  used for strict same-lineage compatibility, because it is the implementation
  most likely to return after an outage
- accepted dependency shape is selected only after active offers; active offers
  remain authoritative for runtime availability, runtime authorization, catalog
  projections, and mixed-version compatibility checks
- graceful shutdown marks the offer stale for the same short grace window used
  for unplanned disconnects
- health heartbeats MAY refresh offer freshness and Console-visible status only
  for an already accepted matching offer; a heartbeat MUST NOT create an offer
  or change the offered digest

This is a clean break from evidence-derived active implementation projections.
Authority history remains useful audit data, but it is not an active
implementation source.

Same-lineage replacement compatibility is defined by the owned communication
surface:

- `rpc`, `operations`, `events`, and `jobs` MUST evolve additively while
  replacement compatibility is being validated
- `uses`, metadata, and other non-owned sections MAY vary by digest as long as
  the presented contract validates successfully and dependency resolution
  against effective active contracts stays unambiguous
- `resources` declarations are validated from the presented contract; they do
  not need to be additive across the lineage, but Trellis MUST validate and bind
  the exact resource set requested by the contract bound to that principal
- physical resource identity is scoped to the deployment and contract lineage,
  not to the digest, so compatible service updates do not lose durable data
  solely because the contract digest changed
- `jobs` are part of the owned execution surface and follow the same additive
  compatibility expectations as other owned contract sections during replacement
  validation

Active-compatible evolution means:

- a new digest MAY add owned RPCs, operations, events, and job queues
- a new digest MAY add optional fields to existing request, response, progress,
  event, and job payload/result schemas when those payload objects remain open
  to unknown fields
- a new digest MAY remove an optional field from an existing payload schema when
  that field is not required by the previously accepted same-instance digest;
  because optional fields may be absent on the wire, same-lineage compatibility
  validation MUST NOT treat removal as a compatibility failure solely because
  the optional field is no longer declared
- a new digest MAY add new declared errors or new capabilities for newly added
  owned surfaces
- a new digest MUST NOT remove or rename an existing owned RPC, operation,
  event, or job queue during compatible replacement validation
- a new digest MUST NOT move an existing owned surface to a different subject
  during compatible replacement validation
- a new digest MUST NOT change an existing schema in a breaking way while old
  and new digests are compared for replacement

Active-compatible projection verifies duplicate same-lineage surfaces by
resolving their schema refs against each digest's `schemas` map. Projection MAY
accept canonically equal resolved schemas, MAY accept optional additive fields
on open object schemas, and MUST tolerate optional field removal when absence is
valid for consumers. Required fields and declared property schemas that remain
in the active projection MUST stay compatible. Projection MUST fail closed for
required-field removal, required/optional-breaking type changes, closed-object
property-set divergence other than tolerated optional removal, unresolved refs,
and any non-identical schema construct whose wire compatibility is not proven by
the supported v1 verifier.

Authoring note:

- additive rollout only works when older runtimes can still validate newer
  payloads that include unknown optional fields
- for TypeBox-authored request, response, progress, and event payload objects,
  do not treat closed-object additional-property rejection as the default
- close a payload object only when rejecting unknown fields is an intentional
  contract rule and mixed-version additive rollout does not need those fields

Breaking schema changes include:

- removing an existing required field that callers or subscribers may still send
  or read
- changing an optional field to required
- changing a field type incompatibly, such as `string` to `object` or `number`
  to `string`
- narrowing allowed enum values or formats in a way that rejects payloads
  accepted by the older digest
- changing payload semantics incompatibly while keeping the same field names and
  operation/RPC/event subjects

If a rollout needs one of those breaking changes, it SHOULD use a new contract
`id` / major version for production deployments. Same-lineage incompatible
replacement is a forceful authority migration, not a compatibility-preserving
replacement. During early unreleased development, an operator MAY mark the
service deployment `mutable-dev` so Trellis auto-accepts the incompatible
same-lineage replacement migration. This is still recorded as an authority
migration in plan/history; it only removes the manual approval step and does not
create a production compatibility guarantee.

### 6.3) Capability metadata and global keys

Contract manifests may declare top-level capability metadata keyed by global
capability key.

Example:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "trellis.jobs::admin.read": {
      "displayName": "Read jobs admin data",
      "description": "View Jobs service health, services, jobs, and dead-letter queues."
    },
    "trellis.jobs::admin.mutate": {
      "displayName": "Mutate jobs admin data",
      "description": "Cancel, retry, replay, or dismiss Jobs service work items.",
      "consequence": "Can change background job execution state."
    }
  }
}
```

The global key format is `<capability namespace>::<local capability>`. The
capability namespace is the contract `id` with a trailing `@vN` major-version
suffix removed. For example, `trellis.jobs@v1` emits capability keys in the
`trellis.jobs::` namespace.

Rules:

- top-level capability entries require `displayName` and `description`; they MAY
  include `consequence` for concise user-facing risk or effect copy
- capability metadata is authored by the contract that owns the authority
- capability metadata is included in the digest projection because review copy
  defines the meaning of the authority being granted
- canonical manifests SHOULD use global keys in top-level `capabilities` and in
  RPC, operation, and event capability lists
- language authoring helpers MAY let authors write local capability names and
  project them into global keys during manifest emission
- only declared local capability names are projected; undeclared strings remain
  raw platform or external capabilities
- dependency contracts are selected through `uses`; callers do not redeclare a
  dependency's capability metadata
- review UIs should render capability metadata first and treat raw keys,
  contract ids, and digests as technical detail

### Declared dependencies (`uses`)

Contracts MAY declare explicit dependencies on other contracts through a
top-level `uses` object. Dependency aliases MUST be grouped under
`uses.required` or `uses.optional`; required aliases fail closed and optional
aliases grant authority only when their target contract and surface resolve in
the effective active contract set.

Example:

```json
{
  "uses": {
    "required": {
      "auth": {
        "contract": "trellis.auth@v1",
        "events": {
          "subscribe": [
            "Auth.Connections.Opened",
            "Auth.Connections.Closed",
            "Auth.Sessions.Revoked",
            "Auth.Connections.Kicked"
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "optional": {
      "core": {
        "contract": "trellis.core@v1",
        "rpc": {
          "call": ["Trellis.Surface.Status"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- dependencies are declared by logical contract `id` plus logical
  operation/RPC/event names, not by raw capability strings
- dependencies are defined only under `uses.required` or `uses.optional`;
  aliases directly under `uses` are invalid and undefined, and callers must not
  rely on any authority or digest semantics for them
- both required and optional uses participate in digest identity
- if the same alias appears in both `required` and `optional`, the required
  entry wins and the optional duplicate is ignored
- a service contract MUST NOT receive cross-contract runtime permissions unless
  that access is declared in `uses` or is a Trellis-defined baseline surface
  automatically available to that participant kind
- connected service and device manifests receive the Trellis-defined baseline
  `health` use automatically, targeting `trellis.health@v1` with
  `events.publish: ["Health.Heartbeat"]`; `trellis.health@v1` itself is excluded
  from this self-use
- if a service or device author explicitly declares `uses.required.health` or
  `uses.optional.health` for `trellis.health@v1`, authoring helpers merge the
  baseline heartbeat publish selector into that alias rather than requiring a
  second alias
- manifest validation is structural and MAY accept referenced contracts that are
  not active yet, but authority planning, reconciliation, and runtime
  authorization MUST NOT derive dependency surfaces from inactive historical
  manifests
- required dependency resolution uses the dependency's effective active contract
  first; if no effective active contract exists, service bootstrap and authority
  planning may use the accepted dependency shape from deployment authority
- if the dependency's active offers are incompatible, Trellis reports a catalog
  compatibility issue for that active lineage and does not resolve the
  dependency from historical manifests
- missing optional contracts and missing optional surfaces do not fail
  structural validation and do not grant transport authority
- if a missing optional contract or surface later becomes active, a fresh
  authority update or authority migration is required before reconnects receive
  that optional authority
- validation happens when resolving dependencies against effective active
  contracts: if a `uses` entry targets a contract with multiple active
  compatible offers, Trellis projects their surfaces together
- that active-offer projection MAY merge additive identical logical surface
  descriptors, but MUST reject divergent duplicate descriptors for the same
  operation, RPC, or event name
- duplicate surface descriptors are compared after resolving schema refs; same
  ref names are not sufficient, and different ref names are acceptable only when
  the resolved schemas are canonically equal or proven compatible by the
  same-lineage schema verifier
- required dependency cycles can be staged through accepted dependency shapes:
  each participant is first accepted into deployment authority, then bootstrap
  can resolve those dependency shapes even before the peer service has an active
  offer. Historical known manifests are still not searched to resolve the cycle.
- higher-level consent scopes for user-facing applications MAY be derived from
  `uses`, but runtime enforcement remains operation-level
- any user consent record for a client contract MUST retain the reviewed
  contract digest for audit, while the durable authority is the resulting
  identity authority

### Runtime surface status

Catalog knowledge, authorization, and runtime availability are separate
decisions. A contract is known when Trellis has stored a validated manifest by
digest. Deployment authority authorizes desired access and resources;
materialized authority is what runtimes receive. A surface is active only when
an enabled service or device offer currently contributes it.
`Trellis.Surface.Status` is an advisory Trellis core RPC that checks known
contract metadata, checks the caller's current materialized authority, and
checks implementation offers only after authorization succeeds.

Status outcomes are:

- `unknown_contract` when the contract id is not known to the catalog
- `unknown_surface` when the known contract lineage has no matching logical RPC,
  operation, event, or feed surface
- `unauthorized` with missing capability keys when the caller's materialized
  authority does not authorize the requested surface
- `unavailable` when the contract is known but the caller's materialized
  authority does not cover the requested surface
- `unavailable` with `dependency_not_active` when the surface depends on a
  contract with no effective active implementation offer
- `available` with `liveImplementer: true` and `runtime: "live"` when an enabled
  connected service or device instance currently offers the requested surface
- `available` with `liveImplementer: false` and `runtime: "no_live_implementer"`
  when the surface is authorized and recently offered within grace but no live
  connection currently implements it
- `available` with `liveImplementer: false` and `runtime: "disabled"` when only
  disabled matching service or device instances currently implement it

Availability MUST NOT grant authority or remove transport permissions that were
already granted from the caller's materialized authority. During mixed-version
rollouts, availability is scoped to the compatible active offers that define the
requested logical surface, not merely to any known digest in the same contract
lineage.

### 7) RPC operation descriptor

Each `rpc` entry describes one logical request/reply operation.

Example:

```json
{
  "schemas": {
    "FindUserRequest": { "type": "object" },
    "FindUserResponse": { "type": "object" }
  },
  "User.Find": {
    "version": "v1",
    "subject": "rpc.v1.User.Find",
    "input": { "schema": "FindUserRequest" },
    "output": { "schema": "FindUserResponse" },
    "capabilities": {
      "call": ["graph::users.read"]
    },
    "errors": [{ "type": "ValidationError" }, { "type": "NotFoundError" }]
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field               | Required | Meaning                                  |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `version`           | yes      | Version tag for the operation, `vN`      |
| `subject`           | yes      | Concrete NATS subject used for the RPC   |
| `input`             | yes      | Schema reference for the request payload |
| `output`            | yes      | Schema reference for the success payload |
| `capabilities.call` | no       | Capabilities required to invoke the RPC  |
| `errors`            | no       | Declared serializable error types        |

Rules:

- the map key is the logical RPC name, for example `User.Find`
- `subject` SHOULD follow the convention `rpc.<version>.<LogicalName>`
- `input` and `output` are required schema refs into the contract-level
  `schemas` map
- `capabilities.call` is an all-of requirement; the caller must hold every
  listed capability
- declared contract-owned capabilities SHOULD appear as global capability keys
  in canonical manifests
- if `capabilities.call` is omitted, the RPC is callable without extra
  capability grants
- `errors` enumerates known typed error payloads but does not close the wire
  format to unknown future error types

### 7a) Operation descriptor

Each `operations` entry describes one logical caller-visible asynchronous
workflow.

Example:

```json
{
  "Billing.Refund": {
    "version": "v1",
    "subject": "operations.v1.Billing.Refund",
    "input": { "schema": "BillingRefundRequest" },
    "progress": { "schema": "BillingRefundProgress" },
    "output": { "schema": "BillingRefundResult" },
    "capabilities": {
      "call": ["billing::billing.refund"],
      "observe": ["billing::billing.refund"],
      "cancel": ["billing::billing.refund.cancel"],
      "control": ["billing::billing.refund.control"]
    },
    "signals": {
      "approveRefund": {
        "input": { "schema": "BillingRefundApproval" }
      }
    },
    "cancel": true
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `subject` SHOULD follow the convention `operations.<version>.<LogicalName>`
- each operation also owns a derived control subject `<subject>.control`
- `input` and `output` are required schema refs; `progress` is optional
- `capabilities.call` gates invocation
- `capabilities.observe` gates `get`, `wait`, and `watch`; if omitted, it
  defaults to `capabilities.call`
- `capabilities.cancel` gates `cancel`; if omitted, callers do not receive
  cancel rights by default
- `capabilities.control` gates named operation signals; if omitted, signal
  submission has no extra capability gate beyond authentication and operation
  ownership, so user-facing post-start inputs SHOULD declare explicit control
  capabilities
- `signals` declares named post-start input schemas for validation, review,
  documentation, digest projection, and generated SDK aliases
- accepted signals are private operation-control inputs; they are persisted with
  an operation-local signal sequence and do not increment the public operation
  snapshot revision
- `cancel: true` declares cancellation support; callers may still have a
  language-level `cancel()` helper, but unsupported cancellation MUST return a
  runtime error frame and MUST NOT mutate operation state
- operations are always authenticated; omitting a capability list removes only
  additional capability grants, not the authentication requirement itself
- operations are durable async contracts, not raw jobs and not unary RPCs
- services own operation-level authorization for specific operation ids; the
  contract only declares the coarse capability gates
- `errors` enumerates known typed error payloads; uses the same
  `ContractErrorRef` schema as RPC error refs

### 8) Event descriptor

Each `events` entry describes one domain event published on a NATS subject.

Example:

```json
{
  "schemas": {
    "PartnerChanged": { "type": "object" }
  },
  "Partner.Changed": {
    "version": "v1",
    "subject": "events.v1.Partner.Changed.{/partner/id/origin}.{/partner/id/id}",
    "params": ["/partner/id/origin", "/partner/id/id"],
    "event": { "schema": "PartnerChanged" },
    "capabilities": {
      "publish": ["partners::partners.write"],
      "subscribe": ["partners::partners.read"]
    }
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field                    | Required | Meaning                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `version`                | yes      | Version tag for the event, `vN`                        |
| `subject`                | yes      | Concrete or templated NATS subject                     |
| `params`                 | no       | Ordered JSON Pointer list used by the subject template |
| `event`                  | yes      | Schema reference for the event payload                 |
| `capabilities.publish`   | no       | Capabilities required to publish the event             |
| `capabilities.subscribe` | no       | Capabilities required to subscribe to the event        |

Rules:

- the map key is the logical event name, for example `Partner.Changed`
- `subject` SHOULD follow the convention
  `events.<version>.<LogicalName>[.<tokens...>]`
- template tokens use the form `{<json-pointer>}` and MUST reference values in
  the event payload
- if `params` is present, it MUST list the template pointers in subject order
- every template pointer MUST resolve to a string, number, or integer-compatible
  schema from the referenced event payload schema; pointers through arrays,
  object schemas, boolean schemas, non-object schemas, or missing properties
  fail contract validation
- for event payload schemas with `anyOf` or `oneOf`, every possible variant MUST
  expose the template pointer and every resolved variant schema MUST be
  tokenable, because any valid payload variant must be able to produce the
  declared subject token
- for event payload schemas with `allOf`, a pointer MAY resolve through the
  composed schema; if multiple `allOf` branches constrain the pointer, every
  resolved constraint MUST be tokenable
- `event` is a required schema ref into the contract-level `schemas` map
- `capabilities.publish` and `capabilities.subscribe` are independent all-of
  requirements
- a wildcard authorization subject for an event is produced by replacing every
  template token with `*`
- that effective wildcard subject is also the subject key used by catalog
  collision checks, so two templated events with different JSON Pointer tokens
  still collide if they normalize to the same NATS wildcard subject

Example wildcard derivation:

- template: `events.v1.Partner.Changed.{/partner/id/origin}.{/partner/id/id}`
- wildcard: `events.v1.Partner.Changed.*.*`

### 8a) Event consumer groups

The optional top-level `eventConsumers` map declares service-owned durable event
consumer groups. These groups are not public event surfaces. They are deployment
resources that tell Trellis which subscribed dependency events or owned events a
service processes with a Trellis-provisioned JetStream pull consumer.

Dependency events are selected with `eventConsumers.<group>.uses`, keyed by
top-level `uses.required` or `uses.optional` aliases. Owned events are selected
with `eventConsumers.<group>.self` and must belong to the declaring contract's
own `events` map.

Example:

```json
{
  "schemas": {
    "ProjectionRebuilt": { "type": "object" }
  },
  "uses": {
    "required": {
      "billing": {
        "contract": "billing@v1",
        "events": { "subscribe": ["Billing.SubscriptionConfirmed"] }
      }
    }
  },
  "events": {
    "BillingProjection.Rebuilt": {
      "version": "v1",
      "subject": "events.v1.BillingProjection.Rebuilt",
      "event": { "schema": "ProjectionRebuilt" }
    }
  },
  "eventConsumers": {
    "workspaceBilling": {
      "uses": {
        "billing": ["Billing.SubscriptionConfirmed"]
      },
      "self": ["BillingProjection.Rebuilt"],
      "replay": "new",
      "ordering": "strict",
      "concurrency": 1,
      "ackWaitMs": 300000,
      "maxDeliver": 6,
      "backoffMs": [5000, 30000, 120000, 600000, 1800000]
    }
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field         | Required | Meaning                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `uses`        | no       | Dependency events, keyed by top-level `uses` alias                       |
| `self`        | no       | Events owned by the same contract                                        |
| `replay`      | no       | `"new"` or `"all"`; defaults to `"new"`                                  |
| `ordering`    | no       | Ordering mode; v1 supports `"strict"` and defaults to `"strict"`         |
| `concurrency` | no       | Handler concurrency; defaults to `1`; strict ordering requires `1`       |
| `ackWaitMs`   | no       | JetStream ack wait in milliseconds; Trellis applies a runtime default    |
| `maxDeliver`  | no       | Maximum delivery attempts; Trellis applies a NATS-valid runtime default  |
| `backoffMs`   | no       | Redelivery backoff in milliseconds, capped to fit `maxDeliver` semantics |

Rules:

- each group MUST include at least one selected dependency event in `uses` or
  one owned event in `self`
- every `eventConsumers.<group>.uses.<alias>` key MUST be present under
  top-level `uses.required` or `uses.optional`; each listed event MUST be
  present in that alias's `events.subscribe` selection
- `eventConsumers.<group>.uses.<alias>` is an alias selector, not a remote
  contract id; dependency durable consumption remains authority-backed through
  the top-level `uses` declaration and accepted/active dependency resolution
- every `eventConsumers.<group>.self[]` entry MUST name an event in the same
  contract's `events` map; `self` never grants dependency authority
- durable service event processing is explicit-only; Trellis does not create an
  implicit consumer group from `uses.events.subscribe`
- the same event MAY appear in multiple groups; each group is an independent
  durable cursor, so duplicate delivery to those groups is intentional
- group names are logical contract aliases; Trellis owns the physical stream,
  durable consumer name, filter subjects, and runtime binding payload
- `eventConsumers` is part of digest identity except for nested `docs` metadata
- authority planning validates referenced dependency event surfaces against
  effective active dependency offers and requested deployment authority before
  acceptance. Owned-event entries resolve directly against the same contract's
  event subjects.
- durable event consumer desired state is accepted into deployment authority;
  reconciliation creates or adopts consumers before exposing materialized
  authority to runtimes
- if a referenced dependency has no effective active offer or accepted
  dependency shape, authority planning fails with a dependency-not-active
  blocker before desired state is changed
- if consumer creation or adoption fails, reconciliation remains pending and no
  runtime receives the missing binding
- event consumer bindings are deployment resources. Service code consumes the
  binding through the connected runtime, not by constructing or naming a
  JetStream durable consumer itself
- runtime durable consumers are Trellis-provisioned only. `.listen()` may attach
  to a reconciled contract group, but it MUST NOT create arbitrary durable
  consumers.
- service principals MUST NOT receive broad event-processing grants such as
  `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DURABLE.CREATE.trellis.>`; auth grants only the exact bound
  consumer subjects required for info, pull-next, and acknowledgements
- ephemeral event listeners remain live direct subscriptions governed by the
  normal `uses.events.subscribe` authority. They do not require an
  `eventConsumers` binding and do not replay stored events

### 9) No raw subject descriptor

The v1 contract model does not expose a top-level `subjects` map or
`uses.*.subjects` declarations. Public and cross-contract communication must be
modeled as RPCs, operations, or events so Trellis can derive typed SDKs,
capabilities, and compatibility from the same surface.

Subsystem-owned raw NATS subjects may still exist behind those contract-owned
APIs. Jobs work subjects, advisories, operation reply subjects, and transfer
chunk subjects are runtime protocol details derived from jobs, operations,
transfer declarations, or materialized resource bindings rather than
caller-authored raw subject entries.

### 10) Cloud resource requests

The optional top-level `resources` map declares cloud-provided resources that a
service requests in its contract proposal. Accepted resource requests become
deployment authority desired state. Reconciliation is the only path that
creates, updates, removes, or adopts materialized resources and bindings.

Example:

```json
{
  "resources": {
    "kv": {
      "activity": {
        "purpose": "Store normalized activity entries",
        "schema": { "schema": "AuditEntry" },
        "required": true,
        "history": 1,
        "ttlMs": 0,
        "maxValueBytes": 262144
      }
    },
    "store": {
      "uploads": {
        "purpose": "Temporary uploaded files awaiting processing",
        "required": true,
        "ttlMs": 86400000,
        "maxTotalBytes": 10737418240
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- resource keys such as `activity` are logical aliases chosen by the service
  author
- aliases are part of the contract and are stable API surface for the service
- the contract proposal requests logical resources; accepted requests become
  deployment authority desired state, and Trellis assigns physical names and
  backing infrastructure during reconciliation
- Trellis validates requested resource declarations from the reviewed contract,
  but chooses physical resource identities at the deployment/lineage scope
  rather than the digest scope
- the v1 resource surface supports `resources.kv` and `resources.store`
- a KV request declares:
  - `purpose`: required human-facing explanation of why the service needs the
    resource
  - `schema`: required schema reference for the JSON value stored in the bucket
  - `required`: whether activation depends on successful materialization;
    default `true`
  - `history`: desired KV history depth; default `1`
  - `ttlMs`: desired bucket TTL in milliseconds; default `0`
  - `maxValueBytes`: optional desired per-value maximum in bytes
- a store request declares:
  - `purpose`: required human-facing explanation of why the service needs the
    resource
  - `required`: whether activation depends on successful materialization;
    default `true`
  - `ttlMs`: optional desired retention in milliseconds; `0` or omitted means no
    automatic expiry requested
  - `maxTotalBytes`: optional desired total-store maximum in bytes; omitted
    means no finite total-size request and reconciles the backing NATS object
    store to the backend sentinel for "no contract-requested finite total limit"
  - `maxObjectBytes`: optional desired per-object maximum in bytes, enforced by
    Trellis runtime write paths when exposed through the materialized binding
- authority acceptance records the requested alias/type/spec, not general
  infrastructure-management credentials for the service
- all accepted resources MUST be materialized before runtime exposure; this
  includes `resources.kv`, `resources.store`, top-level `jobs` bindings, and
  top-level `eventConsumers`
- reconciliation is atomic from Trellis's perspective for each materialization
  attempt: if it cannot persist materialized state, Trellis MUST best-effort
  clean up every NATS resource created by that attempt
- resources adopted from existing matching bindings are never deleted by
  rollback
- deterministic resource names make retry safe when cleanup partially fails;
  retry MUST adopt matching resources rather than creating duplicates
- an existing resource with an incompatible shape or unsafe ownership conflict
  blocks reconciliation before Trellis creates any new resource
- `required: false` remains part of the contract and generated service typing,
  but it is not a best-effort materialization flag; Trellis does not silently
  skip a declared resource because reconciliation failed
- v1 store bindings expose effective runtime limits, including `maxObjectBytes`
  when the contract requested a finite per-object limit; NATS object-store
  `max_bytes` is the total-store limit, while Trellis runtime write paths
  enforce the per-object binding limit

Resource change classification:

- adding a new optional or required resource alias is an approval-required
  authority update when it does not remove or weaken existing materialized
  authority
- increasing non-destructive limits, clarifying `purpose`, or adding a
  compatible event consumer group is usually an auto-applied authority update
- reducing TTL, history, size limits, or retention; changing a KV schema in a
  way that may reject existing values; changing a store's semantics; removing a
  resource alias; or renaming an event consumer group is an authority migration
- event consumers treat adding a new dependency or owned event to an existing
  group as an authority update only when replay and ordering remain compatible;
  removing a dependency or owned event, changing group identity, narrowing
  replay, or changing delivery settings in a way that may skip or duplicate work
  is an authority migration

### 10a) First-class jobs

The optional top-level `jobs` map declares first-class service-private job
queues.

Example:

```json
{
  "jobs": {
    "refundCharge": {
      "payload": { "schema": "RefundChargePayload" },
      "result": { "schema": "RefundChargeResult" },
      "maxDeliver": 5,
      "backoffMs": [5000, 30000, 120000, 600000, 1800000],
      "ackWaitMs": 300000,
      "defaultDeadlineMs": 900000,
      "progress": true,
      "logs": true,
      "dlq": true,
      "concurrency": 1
    },
    "syncTickets": {
      "payload": { "schema": "SyncTicketsPayload" },
      "result": { "schema": "SyncTicketsResult" },
      "concurrency": 4,
      "keyConcurrency": {
        "key": ["zendesk", "/origin", "tickets"],
        "maxActive": 1,
        "stalePolicy": "fail-stale"
      },
      "queue": {
        "maxQueuedPerKey": 1,
        "whenFull": "reject"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- job keys such as `refundCharge` are logical queue names chosen by the service
  author
- the v1 jobs surface is top-level contract data, not a `resources` request
- each queue entry requires `payload.schema`
- each queue entry may include `result.schema`
- each queue entry may include `maxDeliver`; default `5`
- each queue entry may include `backoffMs`; default
  `[5000, 30000, 120000, 600000, 1800000]`
- each queue entry may include `ackWaitMs`; default `300000`
- each queue entry may include `defaultDeadlineMs`
- each queue entry may include `progress`; default `true`
- each queue entry may include `logs`; default `true`
- each queue entry may include `dlq`; default `true`
- each queue entry may include `concurrency`; default `1`. This is the existing
  per-queue worker-count setting.
- each queue entry may include `keyConcurrency.key` to enable opt-in keyed
  concurrency. `keyConcurrency.key` is an ordered array of string constants and
  JSON Pointers into the payload. Pointer segments must resolve to scalar values
  after payload validation.
- keyed queues may include `keyConcurrency.maxActive`; default `1`
- keyed queues may include `keyConcurrency.heartbeatIntervalMs` and
  `keyConcurrency.heartbeatTtlMs`; the TTL must exceed the heartbeat interval
- keyed queues may include `keyConcurrency.stalePolicy`; default `"fail-stale"`.
  `"fail-stale"` records an expired active job as stale before allowing another
  job to acquire the key; `"block"` keeps later jobs waiting until manual or
  normal release.
- keyed queues may include `queue.maxQueuedPerKey`; default `0` when
  `keyConcurrency.key` is present
- keyed queues may include `queue.whenFull`; default `"reject"`. `"coalesce"`
  and `"replace-oldest"` are explicit opt-ins and must not be inferred from
  `maxQueuedPerKey` alone.
- adding keyed concurrency to an existing queue or tightening a keyed queue
  policy can reject or skip work that previously ran and is an authority
  migration
- Trellis owns the shared jobs infrastructure and resolves any internal
  work-stream or projected-state bindings needed by the runtime; ordinary
  service-author APIs should use `service.jobs` rather than raw stream bindings

### 10b) First-class state stores

The optional top-level `state` map declares named Trellis-managed state stores.

Example:

```json
{
  "schemas": {
    "Preferences": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "theme": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["theme"]
    },
    "PreferencesV2": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "theme": { "type": "string" },
        "compact": { "type": "boolean" }
      },
      "required": ["theme", "compact"]
    },
    "Draft": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "title": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["title"]
    }
  },
  "state": {
    "preferences": {
      "kind": "value",
      "schema": { "schema": "PreferencesV2" },
      "stateVersion": "preferences.v2",
      "acceptedVersions": {
        "preferences.v1": { "schema": "Preferences" }
      }
    },
    "drafts": {
      "kind": "map",
      "schema": { "schema": "Draft" }
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- state store keys such as `preferences` and `drafts` are logical store names
  chosen by the contract author
- the v1 state surface is top-level contract data, not a `resources` request
- each state store requires `kind`
- `kind` MUST be either `value` or `map`
- each state store requires `schema`
- `schema` MUST reference an entry in the top-level contract `schemas` map
- `stateVersion` is optional and defaults to `"v1"`
- `stateVersion` is the author-known persisted-state version, not the contract
  digest
- `acceptedVersions` is optional and maps older accepted state versions to
  schema refs in the top-level `schemas` map
- runtimes MUST validate every `acceptedVersions` schema ref during contract
  validation
- state values are JSON on the wire and are validated against the declared store
  schema
- the named store is the public runtime entrypoint; normal callers do not choose
  an arbitrary `scope` or a contract-wide generic keyspace
- admin inspection remains a separate API surface from the normal runtime state
  helpers

Implementation note:

- Rust manifest parsing and builder validation must validate both the primary
  state store schema ref and any `acceptedVersions` schema refs, matching the
  TypeScript-generated manifest semantics

### 11) Error declarations

The optional top-level `errors` map declares named serializable error payloads.

Example:

```json
{
  "ValidationError": {
    "type": "ValidationError",
    "schema": { "type": "object" }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- the map key is a local declaration name; matching `type` is preferred but not
  required
- operation-level `errors` entries reference error types by `type`
- the wire error envelope is open; runtimes MUST preserve unknown error payloads
- declared error schemas enable SDK generation and typed client helpers but do
  not prevent forward-compatible unknown error handling
- manifest-level error declarations stay pure JSON and do not carry
  language-specific runtime metadata such as class constructors
- language runtimes MAY attach out-of-band metadata to local contract objects so
  declared errors can be reconstructed as real runtime error instances without
  changing the canonical manifest format

### 12) Canonicalization and digest

Contracts are content-addressed by the digest of a normalized runtime/interface
projection derived from the canonical manifest.

Canonicalization rules for v1:

- the manifest must be a pure JSON value
- numbers must be finite and must not use negative zero
- object keys are sorted lexicographically during canonicalization
- arrays preserve source order during generic JSON canonicalization
- the canonical JSON string contains no insignificant whitespace

Digest rules for v1:

- algorithm: SHA-256 over the canonical JSON string for the digest projection
- encoding: base64url without padding
- the digest projection includes runtime identity and behavior: `format`, `id`,
  `kind`, `capabilities`, `state`, `uses`, `rpc`, `operations`, `events`,
  `feeds`, `jobs`, `eventConsumers`, `resources.kv`, `resources.store`,
  reachable schemas, and RPC-declared reachable errors
- resource `required` flags participate in the digest because they change
  install, activation, and binding behavior
- the digest projection excludes contract-level `displayName`, `description`,
  `docs`, `exports`, unused schemas, and unused error declarations
- capability metadata is not display-only contract metadata; it participates in
  the digest because it defines the human meaning of granted authority
- set-like arrays such as capabilities, `uses.*` logical-name lists, and RPC
  error lists are sorted and deduplicated before digesting
- order-sensitive arrays such as event params, job backoff schedules, and JSON
  Schema arrays keep their source order

The digest is the deployment/runtime identity of one concrete contract artifact.

This means different formatting, display or docs metadata changes, export-only
changes, and unused local schema changes do not change the digest.
Runtime/interface changes do change the digest, and catalogs and registration
workflows refer to contracts by digest.

### 13) Catalog format

The Trellis runtime exposes its catalog projection as `trellis.catalog.v1`.
Deployment authority and identity authority own durable desired authority.
Authority history is cold review and audit data, and resource binding rows
describe materialized resources for deployments. The global `contracts` store is
the authority for full normalized manifests by digest. In-memory
contract/catalog objects are validation, projection, and cache state only.

Shape:

```json
{
  "format": "trellis.catalog.v1",
  "contracts": [
    {
      "id": "graph@v1",
      "digest": "<base64url-sha256>",
      "displayName": "Graph Service",
      "description": "Serve graph RPCs and publish graph change events."
    }
  ]
}
```

Catalog rules:

- the catalog contains the runtime's active implementation projection: built-in
  Trellis contracts plus non-expired service and device offers
- entries are keyed by digest and include `id`, `displayName`, and `description`
- a catalog MAY include multiple concrete digests for one non-builtin `id`
  during a compatible mixed-version rollout; runtime authorization uses the
  effective active union internally
- a catalog MUST NOT invent a synthetic union digest
- catalog ordering is not semantically significant, but implementations SHOULD
  return a stable order for diffability and testing
- catalog refresh is fail-closed: failure to hydrate required builtin contract
  state MUST fail startup or refresh rather than publishing a partial catalog
- catalog hydration resolves full manifests from built-in Trellis contracts or
  the global `contracts` store; authority history and implementation offer rows
  MUST NOT be used as manifest lookup fallbacks
- catalog refresh and surface-status checks MUST use targeted durable-store
  queries keyed by the relevant deployment, digest, route, or offer records
  rather than scanning nearby local manifests or broad in-memory catalogs
- refresh MUST validate every proposed catalog digest before replacing the
  in-memory catalog; unknown digests or divergent duplicate surfaces keep the
  previous catalog unavailable rather than falling back to partial state
- authority update and authority migration flows MUST use the same validation in
  dry-run mode against staged deployment authority records before mutating
  desired state, so incompatible proposals fail before partial state is
  persisted or exposed to callers
- service and device runtime authority is derived from materialized authority
  and the participant's presented contract; active offers describe
  implementation availability and dependency resolution, not durable authority
- deployment enable/disable validation MUST stage the matching deployment
  authority state, because enabled deployment authority determines whether that
  deployment can authorize a presented contract

Admin contract analysis records SHOULD expose enough derived metadata for CLI
and console review without reimplementing catalog analysis in each client:

- `analysisSummary` includes counts for RPCs, operations, operation controls,
  events, NATS publish/subscribe rules, KV resources, store resources, and jobs
  queues
- `analysis.operations.operations[]` includes `key`, `subject`,
  `wildcardSubject`, `controlSubject`, `wildcardControlSubject`,
  `callCapabilities`, `observeCapabilities`, `cancelCapabilities`, and `cancel`
- `analysis.operations.control[]` includes `key`, `action`, `subject`,
  `wildcardSubject`, and `requiredCapabilities`
- NATS analysis rule `kind` values include operation call, operation handle, and
  operation control rules in addition to RPC, event, transfer, jobs, and
  resource rules

Repository-layout clarification:

- `in-tree` versus `out-of-tree` is not an architectural distinction for service
  contracts
- Trellis-managed contracts such as `trellis.core@v1`, `trellis.auth@v1`, and
  `trellis.state@v1` are ordinary service contracts implemented by the `trellis`
  runtime service
- colocated service contracts MUST be treated the same way as service contracts
  committed in another repo
- a repo MAY carry additional manifests for local development, but they are not
  implicitly authorized or catalog-visible just because they live nearby

### 14) Trellis discovery RPCs

The `trellis.core@v1` contract implemented by the `trellis` runtime service MUST
include runtime discovery RPCs.

Required v1 discovery RPCs:

- `Trellis.Catalog`
- `Trellis.Contract.Get`

Semantics:

#### `Trellis.Catalog`

- returns the runtime `trellis.catalog.v1` projection
- capability: `trellis.core::catalog.read`
- returns a bounded runtime projection; it is not a repository scan, an
  authority source, or a way to enumerate inactive/local manifests
- lists concrete active offered digests; callers use `Trellis.Contract.Get` to
  read a specific known manifest by digest

#### `Trellis.Contract.Get`

- input: contract `digest`
- returns the known contract manifest for that digest, resolved from built-in
  Trellis contracts or the global `contracts` store
- capability: `trellis.core::contract.read`
- for v1, callers only retrieve known contracts through this RPC when their
  contract grants the relevant Trellis-owned `uses` surface

Deployment authority update and migration flows are intentionally not part of
the runtime discovery RPC set.

- initial service deployment creates empty deployment authority desired state
  and a provisioned service instance key
- service runtime bootstrap MAY present the full manifest for the requested
  digest when Trellis does not already know it
- bootstrap validates and stores the presented manifest as a known contract;
  invalid manifests still fail before any authority proposal is recorded
- when required dependencies are unknown, bootstrap and authority planning
  return targeted dependency blockers unless an accepted dependency shape
  supplies the reviewed dependency shape. They MUST NOT derive dependency
  surfaces or capabilities from missing or historical manifests.
- when requested needs from the presented contract are missing from deployment
  authority, bootstrap classifies the delta. Safe updates auto-apply; new
  capability grants, new resource aliases, and strict-mode migrations record a
  proposal and return a blocker so the service runtime can wait and retry.
- service-originated authority proposals are keyed by requester connection and
  requested delta; repeated requests from the same connected requester are
  deduplicated, and proposals created by that requester are removed when it
  disconnects
- if the presented digest has the same `contractId` as the service instance's
  latest accepted digest or offer but is incompatible, bootstrap treats the
  replacement as an authority migration. Production deployments should normally
  use a new contract version for breaking changes; `strict` records a pending
  migration plan, while `mutable-dev` records and auto-accepts that same plan
  for unreleased local iteration.
- when deployment authority exists but required dependency surfaces cannot be
  resolved from effective active offers or accepted dependency shapes, bootstrap
  returns a dependency blocker; service runtimes wait and retry rather than
  receiving runtime credentials
- when the presented digest no longer fits enabled deployment authority,
  bootstrap returns `contract_changed`; runtimes must restart with an
  authority-compatible contract rather than refreshing stale authority
- accepting an authority update or authority migration mutates desired state
  only; runtime bootstrap completes only after reconciliation has materialized
  every required resource and every required dependency in the accepted closure
  is active or has an accepted dependency shape.
- UI and CLI implementations MAY still present a human review screen before
  accepting authority updates or migrations for pre-reviewed rollout workflows

Binding rules:

- bindings remain keyed by contract alias so application code stays stable
  across environments
- KV bindings expose concrete bucket information plus the granted usage limits
  needed by the service runtime
- store bindings expose the resolved physical store `name` plus effective
  retention and size limits needed by the service runtime
- jobs bindings expose a service namespace, the built-in jobs work stream, plus
  resolved queue bindings (`publishPrefix`, `workSubject`, `consumerName`) and
  effective per-queue runtime settings
- event consumer bindings expose the Trellis-owned event stream, physical
  `consumerName`, filter subjects, replay policy, ordering, concurrency, ack
  wait, max-deliver, and redelivery backoff for each declared group
- jobs bindings do not expose admin projection storage such as durable
  worker-presence buckets; services discover queue/runtime settings only
- services discover concrete resources through bindings rather than through
  general cloud-management credentials
- reconciliation writes materialized resource bindings, and authenticated
  service bootstrap returns the resolved binding payload to runtime helpers
- the bootstrapped service runtime MUST use the bootstrap binding payload
  instead of requiring the service principal to call discovery RPCs after
  connect
- service principals only call discovery RPCs when their presented contract
  grants the relevant Trellis-owned `uses` surface; resource bindings alone do
  not grant general core discovery access

### 15) Installation and activation rules

The `trellis` runtime service owns the durable deployment records that define a
deployment's deployment authority.

The `trellis` runtime service MUST:

- validate manifests against `trellis.contract.v1`
- compute canonical digests
- upsert full normalized manifests into the global `contracts` store by digest
- store authority history by reviewed digest; any redundant contract JSON in
  history records is historical/review data only, not a manifest lookup fallback
- treat `contractId` as globally unique within one Trellis runtime for subject
  ownership and SDK identity
- store reviewed history rows covered by enabled deployment authority as cold
  review/audit data; history does not promote non-builtin contracts into the
  active implementation projection
- maintain durable deployment authority and history rows for the deployment and
  publish an in-memory catalog only as a fail-closed projection
- reject subject collisions across operations, RPCs, and events using the
  effective subject after event-template wildcard normalization
- reconcile every accepted cloud resource before runtime bootstrap receives the
  materialized binding
- persist materialized resource bindings so service bootstrap can return them to
  runtime helpers
- bind each service deployment authority record to the service identity that
  implements it, including Trellis-owned contracts bootstrapped onto the
  `trellis` service identity
- support deployment-owned device deployment records that resolve a device class
  to deployment authority and a presented contract
- support auth-owned login portal route selectors for browser login and
  deployment-owned portal-route metadata for device-activation routing, with
  built-in Trellis portal paths as the fallback
- remove the old submission/review flow rather than preserving a compatibility
  path
- ensure any stored user consent decision references the identity authority
  delta and presented contract being accepted

Authority update and migration validation MUST also:

- reject impossible or unsafe resource combinations before desired state changes
- validate newly accepted service digests and their effective active dependency
  surfaces before reconciliation begins
- reject service or device deployment authority changes when canonical digest
  computation differs from the caller's reviewed presented contract digest
- validate the exact `resources` requested by the presented contract
- validate the exact `eventConsumers` requested by the presented contract and
  record their desired deployment-scoped consumers before acceptance succeeds
- preserve physical resource identity across compatible contract changes for the
  same deployment and lineage unless an operator intentionally creates a new
  lineage
- when activation or runtime auth is deployment-driven, validate that the
  presented contract fits that deployment's authority
- login portal routes are auth-owned routing config for browser UX, while device
  portal routes remain deployment-owned routing config; neither form is a
  contract kind, standalone portal authority, or source of portal-specific
  service-auth behavior
- grant overrides are deployment-owned metadata layered on top of deployment
  authority; web rows are keyed by `contractId + origin`, session-keyed rows are
  keyed by `contractId + sessionPublicKey`, and both may pre-authorize authority
  and capability decisions without changing deployment authority semantics or
  inventing availability

Operationally, authority planning or reconciliation fails if any of these
conditions is true:

- any operation, RPC, or event subject string is already owned by a different
  known contract `id` in the validation set
- any declared resource request cannot be reconciled according to platform
  policy
- any declared event consumer group cannot be resolved to accepted subscribed
  dependency events, declared owned events, or reconciled as a bound JetStream
  consumer
- reconciliation returns pending or waiting after creating any NATS resource but
  before persisting the corresponding materialized authority and binding state

Same-contract replacement rule:

- `contractId` is globally unique within one Trellis runtime, but deployment
  authority authorizes desired state rather than selecting one non-builtin
  digest as active authority
- each service instance presents one exact contract digest at any moment
- in `strict` mode, a service instance may replace its current same-contract
  digest immediately only when same-lineage compatibility validation succeeds;
  incompatible replacement records a pending authority migration plan
- in `mutable-dev` mode, Trellis still validates same-lineage compatibility, but
  auto-accepts and records the resulting authority migration when the
  replacement is incompatible so unreleased local development can iterate
  without inventing a production compatibility promise
- instances that present an authority-incompatible contract are rejected with
  `contract_changed`; instances that present an incompatible same-contract offer
  enter the authority migration path before the new offer becomes active
- authority update and authority migration remain separate decision paths for
  desired-state changes and forceful same-contract replacement. Safe updates
  auto-apply, new capability grants and new resource aliases require update
  approval, and compatibility mode controls whether migrations require manual
  approval or are auto-approved for development.

Subject collision rule:

- if two known surfaces declare the same effective subject, validation MUST fail
  unless they are the same operation, RPC, or event surface in the same contract
  `id` lineage
- templated event subjects compare by the wildcard subject produced by replacing
  each template token with `*`, not by the literal JSON Pointer tokens in the
  template
- overlapping subjects for the same operation/RPC/event surface across candidate
  replacement digests in the same lineage are allowed during validation only
  when same-lineage compatibility keeps the subject meaning unambiguous

This keeps routing, discovery, and permission derivation unambiguous.

### 16) Authorization derivation

Authorization is derived from the presented contract plus materialized authority
for the deployment or identity.

For each authority-compatible presented contract:

- operations contribute publish permissions for callers via `capabilities.call`
  on the declared operation subject, plus `capabilities.observe` and
  `capabilities.cancel` on the derived control subject as applicable
- RPCs contribute publish permissions for callers via `capabilities.call`
- events contribute publish permissions via `capabilities.publish`
- events contribute subscribe permissions via `capabilities.subscribe`
- feeds contribute publish permissions for feed request subjects via
  `capabilities.subscribe`; feed responses use the caller's authenticated inbox
  subscribe permission
- `uses` contributes the exact cross-contract operation/RPC/event/feed
  permissions the owning service may exercise at runtime after dependency
  resolution validates the referenced effective active surfaces
- operation uses that declare `transfer: { direction: "send", ... }` and grant
  `capabilities.call` contribute caller publish access to
  `transfer.v1.upload.*.*`
- RPC uses that declare `transfer: { direction: "receive" }` and grant
  `capabilities.call` contribute caller subscribe access to
  `transfer.v1.download.*.*`

For each materialized resource binding:

- Trellis MAY derive additional runtime permissions needed to use the bound
  resource
- those permissions are scoped to the materialized physical resource binding,
  not to general management APIs for the whole cloud
- store bindings may require both publish and subscribe grants depending on the
  backing implementation; those grants still remain service-local to the owning
  binding
- event-consumer bindings grant only exact bound JetStream subjects such as
  `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.<stream>.<consumerName>`,
  `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.<stream>.<consumerName>`, and
  `$JS.ACK.<stream>.<consumerName>.>` plus any required JetStream info subject
- higher-level runtimes use the binding payload returned by authenticated
  service bootstrap as the binding source of truth and expose typed resource
  handles to service code rather than issuing service-principal discovery RPCs
  during startup

Rules:

- each capability list is an all-of requirement
- operation control subjects MUST be derived deterministically from the declared
  operation subject so auth and SDK generation remain contract-driven
- operation control publish grants currently use `capabilities.observe` and
  `capabilities.cancel` as applicable; holding only `capabilities.call` does not
  grant broad control-subject access beyond the operation-specific control
  subject
- generated runtime operation descriptors include `controlCapabilities` so
  services and clients can reason about signal gates even where catalog NATS
  permission derivation has not yet materialized separate signal-only grants
- `capabilities.cancel` gates only cancellation; it is not a fallback for named
  signals
- `capabilities.control` gates named signals; it is not a fallback for
  cancellation
- deployments that need signal-only callers, with neither observe nor cancel
  rights, need capability-derived control-subject grants for
  `capabilities.control`; that NATS permission derivation is not yet part of the
  current catalog analysis
- omitted `capabilities.observe` defaults to `capabilities.call`, so callers
  that can start an operation can also observe that operation unless the
  contract declares a different observe list
- an explicit empty `observe`, `cancel`, or `control` capability list means
  authenticated callers need no additional Trellis capability for that action
- templated event subjects are authorized using wildcard subjects derived by
  replacing each template token with `*`
- service sessions receive cross-contract permissions only from explicit `uses`,
  Trellis-defined baseline surfaces, and materialized resource bindings; raw
  capability grants alone are not sufficient
- service-side transfer subscriptions are scoped to accepted implementation
  offers for the service identity and to the service session prefix, not broad
  global transfer prefixes

Service-side RPC handling rule:

- a service may subscribe to RPC subjects for contracts covered by materialized
  authority and accepted implementation offers for its authenticated service
  identity
- a service may subscribe to operation subjects and derived operation control
  subjects for contracts covered by materialized authority and accepted
  implementation offers for its authenticated service identity
- runtime ownership is determined by materialized authority, accepted
  implementation offers, and enabled service deployment/instance records, not by
  contract metadata alone
- the bootstrapped `trellis` runtime service follows the same ownership rule;
  Trellis-owned contracts such as `trellis.core@v1`, `trellis.auth@v1`, and
  `trellis.state@v1` are intentionally bootstrap-active on that service identity

This service-ownership subscription rule is separate from caller capability
checks.

### 17) SDK derivation

SDKs derive from the canonical manifest, not from deployment-specific runtime
state.

For every supported language, the same manifest is the input to
language-specific generators, native authoring helpers, generated SDK packages,
or participant facades. Exact package export inventories, crate modules, type
aliases, and helper signatures belong in `/api`, generated TypeScript reference,
and Rustdoc.

The minimum required property is consistent semantics across languages:

- the same logical operation names
- the same operation, RPC, and event subjects
- the same schemas
- the same declared capability requirements
- the same known error declarations

If a contract declares `resources`, SDKs SHOULD expose the logical aliases and
typed binding payloads returned by service bootstrap, typically as part of
connect rather than through ad hoc application calls.

### 18) Runtime plugin projection

A contract may be projected into a runtime API module used by Trellis
client/server libraries.

For v1 TypeScript runtimes, that projection is a defined contract module
consumed by public runtime bootstrap helpers such as
`TrellisClient.connect(...)`, `TrellisService.connect(...)`, and
`TrellisDevice.connect(...)`.

Equivalent projections in other languages may be generated participant facades,
SDK modules, or runtime descriptors. This document owns the projection
requirements; language-library guides and API reference own ordinary usage
examples and exact helper names.

Projection requirements:

- preserve logical operation/RPC/event names
- preserve schemas needed for runtime validation
- preserve enough metadata for typed operation, request, response, publish, and
  subscribe helpers
- fail fast on duplicate merged RPC/event keys

### 19) AsyncAPI export

AsyncAPI is a derived documentation format.

Trellis tooling SHOULD support exporting a contract or catalog to
AsyncAPI-compatible documentation artifacts.

AsyncAPI is not the canonical runtime model because Trellis requires native
representation of:

- operation workflows
- RPC operations
- capability requirements
- subsystem-owned runtime subject spaces behind contract-owned APIs
- activation and catalog semantics

## Notes

- This document defines the architecture and the v1 contract/catalog
  specification.
- Language-specific authoring helpers are implementation details around the
  canonical manifest.
- A separate companion document may define service-specific authoring ergonomics
  for a particular language if needed, but this document is the normative
  contract boundary.
