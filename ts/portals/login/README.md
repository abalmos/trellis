# Trellis Login Portal

Trellis-owned SvelteKit portal for browser auth UX and the default device
activation route. The portal is deployment-owned browser routing, not a special
contract kind.

The app has two distinct roles:

- `/_trellis/portal/users/login` renders Trellis-owned browser auth flow state.
  Approval actions use the shared portal helpers and submit the auth endpoint's
  canonical `approved: boolean` request body.
- Provider choice and OAuth/OIDC redirect handling stay server-owned. The portal
  renders provider options from `GET /auth/flow/:flowId`; it does not carry
  provider secrets, redirect-base config, or auth runtime dependency wiring.
- Browser apps should return to their app-local login route when an active
  session is revoked or missing. The built-in portal remains the provider and
  approval UX that app-local login routes start or resume.
- Detached CLI agent reauthentication uses the same `flowId` portal state as
  browser apps. When the redirect target resolves back to the current portal
  page, the portal stays on its completion screen so the user can return to the
  terminal instead of looping back through browser navigation.
- Account flows under `/_trellis/portal/account/*` complete identity-link and
  local password setup/reset links created by Trellis admin or self-service
  RPCs.
- Admin flows under `/_trellis/portal/admin/*` handle first-admin bootstrap
  without requiring a separate custom portal contract.
- Local username/password sign-in is available when the portal flow state
  exposes local credentials as an enabled provider; provider choice and
  credential verification remain server-owned.
- `/_trellis/portal/devices/activate` resumes a preserved `flowId` after sign-in
  and starts the `Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Resolve` operation over the Trellis
  runtime. Review-required deployments continue watching that same operation;
  the admin review decision completes it with the activated or rejected terminal
  result. There is no portal-side review polling fallback: the Trellis service
  records pending-review progress and defers terminal completion durably until
  the review RPC decides the operation.
- SvelteKit runtime assets are served under `/_trellis/assets/*` to keep the
  built-in portal's asset namespace inside the Trellis-owned prefix.

## Local dev

1. Start NATS and the Trellis runtime/control-plane service.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you want to override local defaults.
3. Optionally set `PUBLIC_TRELLIS_URL` to override the Trellis
   runtime/control-plane service origin.
4. `deno task dev`

The portal defaults to the browser origin that served it, so packaged Trellis
images can run behind any public hostname without rebuilding the image.
`PUBLIC_TRELLIS_URL` remains an override for custom portal deployments.
Non-browser local tooling falls back to `http://localhost:3000` when it is
unset.

The example `.env` is suitable for standalone local dev against the Trellis
runtime/control-plane service on `http://localhost:3000`. You can also override
it directly from the shell, for example:

```bash
PUBLIC_TRELLIS_URL=http://localhost:3000 deno task dev
```

Static builds can also override `PUBLIC_TRELLIS_URL` at build time when needed:

```bash
PUBLIC_TRELLIS_URL=http://localhost:3000 deno task build
```

NATS WebSocket still defaults to `ws://localhost:8080`. NATS is required for
`/_trellis/portal/devices/activate` because that route starts and watches the
`Auth.DeviceUserAuthorities.Resolve` operation over the Trellis runtime. Device
connect info is served separately by `POST /auth/devices/connect-info`.

Portal approval and activation copy should describe exact-digest authorization.
User approvals are for the delegated app or agent contract digest shown in the
flow state, not just for the display name. Device activation is bound to the
device deployment and the presented device contract digest; Trellis will not
pick another digest from the deployment allow-list if the device presents a
retired or unknown digest.

For browser app login, dependency checks resolve against the active catalog. A
service contract digest becomes active for these checks when it is applied to an
enabled service deployment; Trellis does not wait for a service instance to
connect. If the implementing service is down, follow-on app calls may fail, but
the portal should not describe that as an inactive contract dependency.

For device-user authority resolution to succeed, the portal contract boundary
must fit the relevant device deployment authority. Trellis fails the authority
resolution path instead of substituting another contract when the presented
contract is unknown or exceeds the deployment authority.

If a custom portal needs to call Trellis after login, model that follow-on
access with a normal `app` contract and deployment-owned portal routing. Passive
portals that only render flow state do not need their own Trellis contract.

Custom portal selection is deployment-owned routing policy. Browser login
selections are keyed directly by app contract id, device activation selections
are keyed directly by device deployment id, and a `null` portal id explicitly
selects this built-in portal for that key.

Approval decisions are keyed by the normalized contract identity digest. Portal
copy may show `displayName` and `description`, but edits to that display
metadata alone do not require users to approve a new app or agent identity.

Schema-affecting app changes are different: Trellis accepts same-lineage active
digests only when duplicate surfaces resolve to compatible schemas. Optional
fields may be added or removed while absence remains valid for consumers, but
closed-object additions, required-field removal, or required-field changes
produce a new digest that must be handled as an incompatible contract change.
Embedded schemas are self-contained Draft 2019-09 values; portal/app contract
authors should use Trellis schema references at surface declaration sites rather
than JSON Schema `$ref` inside the embedded schemas.
